olympus-flexoform-scanner,Olympus FlexoFORM Scanner,"<p>The innovative FlexoFORM™ scanner makes challenging pipe elbow corrosion inspection easier. With flexible phased array technology, one probe is all you need to cover the full range of elbow diameters.<br>Pipe elbows are susceptible to damage, such as from flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC). However, inspecting them poses unique challenges. Because their surface shape changes from convex on the extrados (outside curve) to concave on the intrados (inside curve), and because many diameter standards exist, ultrasonic testing to evaluate damage in the elbow was limited to doing spot check thickness measurements using probes with small footprints.</p>

aeroqual-aqm-65-ambient-air-monitoring-station,Aeroqual AQM 65 Ambient Air Monitoring Station,"The AQM 65 is a fully integrated air monitoring station that delivers ‘near reference‘ levels of performance. The size of a large suitcase it can measure up to 20 different gaseous and particulate pollutants and environmental parameters simultaneously. The AQM 65 offers the optimal balance between performance and price – measuring criteria pollutants to WHO air quality limits yet costing 3-5 x less than a traditional station based on analyzer technology.<br><br>With the AQM 65, you can continuously measure common air pollutants including ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds (VOC), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter (TSP, PM10, PM2.5, PM1), noise and meteorological parameters such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and direction.<br><br>Linked together in a network, and coupled with remote data acquisition, AQM 65s will form a lower cost, high-density ambient pollution monitoring system for a city or industrial perimeter. With near reference levels of performance, the AQM 65 ensures air quality data is reliable and robust and traceable back to recognized international standards e.g. USEPA (40 CFR Part 53) and EU (2008/50/EC).<br><br>The compact size has numerous advantages. The unit can be transported by car, carried by two people, and installed and operational in under 30 minutes. This makes deployment and relocation quick and easy. It also opens up monitoring locations that were previously inaccessible to traditional monitoring stations. Because the enclosure is small, the energy required for temperature control is much lower than for a traditional monitoring station. Lower power consumption opens up the possibility of a remote power supply and further decreases the total cost of ownership.<br><br>The modular design of the AQM 65 increases flexibility and makes maintenance and servicing easy. Order your AQM 65 with as many or as few sensors as you like – then purchase additional sensors when you need them. The sensors, packaged in modules, can be individually removed from the enclosure and sent away for servicing or simply swapped out for a new one. Such convenience decreases downtime and lowers the total cost of ownership. In a network, you can also move sensor modules from one monitoring location to another according to your needs.<br><br>Unlike other sensor-based instruments the AQM 65 is designed to be calibrated using standard calibration equipment used to calibrate ambient air quality analyzers. This ensures your measurements will be robust and traceable back to reference standards. We also offer calibration equipment specifically designed for the AQM 65 – the AirCal 1000 portable calibrator and the AirCal 8000 which comes fully integrated with your AQM 65 system.<br><br>The AQM 65 is supported by a global distribution network, meaning you’re never too far from a skilled technician ready to provide assistance and spare parts. In addition, Aeroqual’s online training system is free to all our customers, meaning you can become an expert on your AQM system before it even arrives.<br><br>Once the instrument operating system is installed- Aeroqual Connect – lets you access data, assess performance and diagnose faults remotely (if you choose to give us access, we can help with that too).

It is designed for those who need to monitor and manage multiple outdoor dust and particle size fractions simultaneously and in real-time.<br><br>The Dust Sentry Pro delivers simultaneous measurement of PM10, PM2.5, PM1, TSP, and particulate counts for 8 channels: 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 10 microns. <br><br>Options to integrate environmental sensors, such as wind, noise, weather and solar radiation make this a complete air monitoring solution for your project.<br><br>Packaged in a robust weather-proof, lockable enclosure, the Dust Sentry Pro is light enough for one-person site installations. Integrated solar shielding prevents the enclosure from overheating in climates with high solar irradiance.<br><br><strong>Smart technology</strong><br>The Dust Sentry Pro comprises an optical particle counter that converts counts to a mass fraction via a proprietary algorithm stored in the system firmware. Measurements are logged and reported in real-time. The Dust Sentry Pro is configured to display and log particle mass by default. However, there is also an option to configure the instrument to record particle counts.<br><br>The particle counter uses scattered light to measure and count particles. Light from a laser diode is collimated to illuminate the aerosol sample flow. When a particle is present it scatters the incident laser light which is detected using a 60-degree solid angle elliptical mirror at right angles to the laser beam. The amount of scattered light is converted to a voltage pulse and the amplitude of the pulse is calibrated to a particle diameter. The particles are thus assigned on the basis of size to one of eight channels. An on-board temperature sensor corrects for thermal drift, and a sheath air filter keeps the optics clean even in harsh environments.<br><br><strong>Air monitoring software and communication</strong><br>The instrument includes an embedded PC, up to 20 years of onboard data storage, and two powerful software systems. Aeroqual Connect is the instrument operating software. It opens in your browser so no software needs to be installed or updated.

grundfos_200w_reel,"GRUNDFOS  Pump, 200' With Reel","<p>This pump does it all. The smooth, uninterrupted flow of the Redi-Flo2 submersible pump makes it ideal for groundwater purging or sampling and conducting aquifer tests to a depth of 250 feet. The adjustable flow rate on the Redi-Flo2 lets the operator purge and sample in a single uninterrupted stream. A powerful nine gallons per minute capacity can be dialed in without throttling. When purging is complete, the flow rate can be changed to a low flow of 100ml per minute, providing maximum control oversampling. Constructed of stainless steel, the pump meets all specifications for environmental applications. Motor leads are available in 100, 200, and 300-foot lengths. The Mini-Reel is a smaller alternative to the 100-feet standard-sized reel, for easy transport to remote locations.</p>

schonstedt_magnetic_locator_model_ga-72_cd,Schonstedt Magnetic Locator Model GA-72 Cd,"<h3>Easy-To-Use</h3>
<p>The GA-52Cx and GA-72Cd Locators detect the magnetic field of iron and steel objects and energized power lines. Both provide audio detection signals that peak in frequency when the locator's tip is held directly over the target. The GA-72Cd has the option of nulling or peaking</p>
<h3><em>No. 1 Around the World in Performance and Reliability.</em></h3>
<h4>Quality Is Our Hallmark</h4>
<p>Schonstedt's underground magnetic locators have been setting the standards for reliability and dependability for over 30 years. They are designed to withstand the rigors of daily on-site usage and a wide range of environmental conditions. In fact, the Model GA-52Cx is so rugged and dependable it's backed by a 7-year warranty and the Model GA-72Cd is backed by a 5-year warranty.</p>
<h4>Only two Controls</h4>
<p>Designed for one-hand operations, the On/Off-Sensitivity and Volume controls are located on the underside of the cover on both locators. This provides easy access, protects the knobs and contributes to their overall ruggedness and dependability.</p>
<p>The GA-72Cd also has easy-to-read digital and bar graph which displays of signal strength and polarity. Once you have located a target using the audio signal, the digital readout and polarity indicators will help you to visually pinpoint the target and, in some instances, even determine its orientation.</p>
<h4>Signal Strength and Polarity Indications</h4>
<p>The GA-72Cd's audio signal and the 3-digit LCD readout will peak, and the (+) or (-) bar graph will expand to full scale when its tip is directly over a vertical iron pipe. One end of a horizontal target will be (+) and the other will be (-). This difference is very significant because it helps you to distinguish between vertical and horizontal pipes.</p>
<p>With the GA-72Cd you can select any one of four sensitivity settings; the GA-52Cx offers five sensitivity settings. The GA-72Cd's LCD bar graph shows the selected gain and the battery status. The GA-72Cd's headset jack can be connected to your data logger using a standard stereo audio plug.</p>
<h4>Choice of Two Audio Modes</h4>
<p>The GA-72Cd is configured initially to provide an audio signal that is always present (Audio Output switch set to ''B''). If you do not want to hear a signal until the locator is within the detection range of a target, you can set the Audio Output Switch to ''A''.</p>
<h3>FEATURES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Five Year Warranty</li>
<li>Digital readout and expanding bar graph displays signal strength and polarity</li>
<li>4 Sensitivity settings: Low, Medium, High, and Extra High</li>
<li>Piezoelectric speaker</li>
<li>Analog output for data logger entry</li>
<li>60-Hours operational life (intermittent usage) on 2 lithium 9-volt batteries</li>
<li>First locator to use Environmentally Friendly and Safe, lithium batteries. The unit is shipped with two 9-volt lithium batteries installed, and a spare set of batteries stored in the case. Lithium batteries provide twice the life of alkalines, and have a 10-year shelf life.</li>

qed_ap4plus_overview,QED AP4Plus,"<p><strong>Easier to Disassemble and Clean</strong></p>
<p>The AP4+ was made easier to clean by using 3 bolts to attach the pump inlet and open up the pump. This is easier than having to rotate the inlet multiple turns to unthread it from the center tube inside the pump, especially under field conditions of silt, deposits and coatings. Removing the inlet is also aided by the new, precision ID pump casing, ensuring a more controlled fit. The new pump casing's smoother internal surface has the added benefit of reducing the rate of buildup of solids and coatings inside in some cases. The Easy Fittings make it a snap to remove the tubing from the pump without cutting, and the float is now easily removed by pulling a clip.</p>
<p><strong>Upgraded Materials</strong></p>
<p>The new AP4+ features upgraded materials for many parts to further extend the service life of the pump and to broaden the range of conditions each model can be used in. All nonmetallic internal parts are now made of PVDF*; this is   a high-grade engineering plastic with higher strength at elevated temperatures and extremely broad chemical resistance, including to acidic and oxidizing cleaning agents sometimes used for pump maintenance.

It also may be used as a source of purge air for permeation tube ovens or burner air for FID analyzers. The regenerative, heatless dryer removes water and produces gas with a dewpoint of less than -20°C (up to 15 SLPM flow rate) independent of the inlet dewpoint and assists in the removal of other gases, greatly increasing the life of the chemical scrubbers. The basic Model 701 includes an oil and diaphragm free pump plus scrubbers to remove SO2, NO, NO2, O3, NH3, and H2S. Optional high-performance scrubbers are available to remove CO and Hydrocarbons.   Inlet air is pulled into the pump and routed through a pre-cooler and water trap to remove moisture. The air then passes through the regenerative scrubber for final drying and then to the storage tank. The tank pressure is monitored and maintained at a preset level by cycling the pump automatically as needed, thereby extending both the pump and scrubber life. Outlet air then passes through a filter to assure a clean,<br> dry, analytical zero air supply. A microcontroller cycles the regenerative dryer and water trap valves preventing the pump from starting against full head pressure.

fieldscout_direct_soil_ec_meter,FieldScout Direct Soil EC Meter,"<p>This instrument has been specifically designed for direct measurement of salts in soil media as well as water or nutrient solutions. The salinity of the soil solution, irrigation water or fertilizer solution is an important parameter affecting the root zone environment. Any of these factors can have a significant effect on plant growth and physiology. The easiest way to monitor salinity is by measuring the electrical conductivity (EC). EC is strongly correlated to the salinity of the soil solution. EC measurement is also affected by temperature and, to a lesser degree, by soil moisture content.   Use this portable EC meter and probe to measure salinity in greenhouse soil media right on the spot without tedious soil sampling and preparation. Greenhouse production managers can compare readings from plant to plant and fine-tune their fertility program because measurements can be made directly in a plug tray cell without cannibalizing the seedlings. Turf managers can monitor for high salt levels on golf course greens and determine when to flush (leach) salts before turf quality declines. The meter comes with the Field Scout Soil/Water EC probe. This single, stainless steel probe has a specially designed conical tip. It can measure liquid EC (water or nutrient solutions) or In-Situ soil salinity. The probe automatically compensates for temperature.</p>
<p>Pine also offers the 24"" probe for this unit.</p>",Pine Environmental,Equipment,"Esale, Rental, Soil Analysis, Soil Meters",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54969,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1341.jpg?v=1592516113,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

<p><strong> Stakeless testing system</strong><br> <br> The Fluke 1630 uses the Stakeless testing method, which eliminates the need to disconnect parallel ground rods and find suitable locations for placing auxiliary ground stakes.  This saves time and enables users such as industrial and utility electricians, and field service electricians and contractors, to perform earth ground loop tests in locations where it is not possible to use other techniques, including inside buildings or on power pylons.  With the Stakeless testing method, earth ground stakes are no longer necessary. </p>
<p>The Fluke 1630 Earth Ground Clamp is placed around the earth ground rod or the connecting cable.  A known voltage is induced by one half of the clamp and the current is measured by the other half.  The tester automatically determines the ground loop resistance at this grounding connection.  For stakeless testing at least two ground rods (or ground connections of the ground system under test to earth) are required to close the loop the test voltage is induced.</p>",Fluke,Equipment,"Electrical & Power Monitoring, Esale, Power Quality Analyzers, Rental, Soil Meter",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54906,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1311.jpg?v=1592516075,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

alpha_lab_vector_magnitude_gaussmeter,Alpha Lab Vector/Magnitude Gaussmeter,"<p>The Vector Gaussmeter displays the true magnitude of the field at any location as well as the X Y Z components of up to 800 gauss. Also separately displays peak values of X Y Z and magnitude.  There is a sound alarm that determines the locations where the field magnitude exceeds user-set threshold.</p>
<p>Because magnitude is measured the orientation of the sensor (E-W N-S and up-down) is not important; this is unlike a 1-axis gaussmeter.  With the VGM the user can set the alarm to 15 gauss (for example) and it will sound (simultaneous with a red light) whenever the field exceeds 15 gauss for at least 5 milliseconds.  Using the meter this way it is easy to make a map of the 15 gauss line (or for whatever threshold is set) around a strong magnet. When using the alarm of a steel part can be rapidly scanned to show if any areas exceed the set threshold.  Then the ""peak hold"",function can be interrogated showing the peak values of X Y Z (including polarity) and magnitude that occurred during the scan.  Peak hold also has a 5 millisecond response time.</p>
<p>The ""reset"",button resets all peak hold registers to the present values of X Y Z and magnitude which are displayed in real time when the knob is set to ""measure.""  Offsets can be manually applied to X, Y and Z or a ""relative zero"",can be applied to all three.

qed_pneumatic_displacement_pump_pulse_pump,QED Pneumatic Displacement Pump - Pulse Pump,"<p>Cleanup well conditions can be downright hostile: powerful solvents, gasoline and fuel oil, strong acids, caustic bases, corrosive chlorides. That's why QED makes the Pulse Pump series (our basic gas displacement pumps) in a variety of proven materials that won't just survive, but will deliver years of trouble-free performance.</p>
<p>Every Pulse Pump model has only two moving parts downwell: high-clearance, self-cleaning ball check valves. This simplicity keeps them working when high solids, viscosity, or chemical attack cause other pumps to clog or breakdown. An external controller is required to control the alternating pressurization and venting cycles for the pump.</p>
<p>The Pulse Pump design is especially suited for sinking hydrocarbons (DNAPL) recovery, which is often complicated by high viscosity and/or extremely aggressive solvents.</p>
<p>Intrinsically safe Pulse Pump systems are fast and easy to install, with no electrical connections at the wellhead.</p>
<p>Flow optimization is simple too; rugged, dependable pumps and controllers (the solar/AC powered C100M and the all-pneumatic L360) deliver reliable operation without needing frequent attention or repair.</p>

alphalab_dc_milligauss_meter_3_axis,AlphaLab DC Milligauss Meter 3 Axis,"<p>An improvement on the flux gate magnetometer, the AlphaLab DC Milligauss Meter measures magnetic fields (technically ""flux density""), up to several times the strength of the Earth field.  It has a resolution of 0.01 milligauss (1 nanotesla) and a range of +/-2000 milligauss (200 microteslas).  The meter's three magnetoresistive sensors are a major improvement over an uncompensated fluxgate magnetometer both in cost and stability.  In fact, the sensors approach a proton precession magnetometer in temperature stability.</p>
<p><strong>Each of the three displays has an extra digit compared with most portable magnetometers.</strong></p>
<p>Each is 4  ½ digits and displays in two ranges: +/- 1999.9 and +/- 199.99 milligauss. Update is three per second.  Because the Earth's field is typically about 500 milligauss, nine ""offset"",controls (three for each of X,Y,Z) allow you to add or subtract up to 600 milligauss with precision of .01 milligauss.  Therefore, the Earth's field can be subtracted out when required.                                            If reading in the more sensitive 199.99 range, this field neutralization feature is often necessary, because the field is usually stronger than 200 milligauss.</p>
<p>The wide dynamic range of the displays (19,999 count; both polarities), along with the large range of offset (+/- 600 milligauss) and high stability of the meter (+/- .01 milligauss), allow for stable detection of small changes in a large background field. On the higher sensitivity range, changes of .01 milligauss can be reproducibly measured in up to +/- 800 milligauss of background field. On the lower sensitivity range, absolute field of .1 milligauss can be measured in up to +/- 1999.9 milligauss of background field.</p>
<p>The sensor is a 25 mm (one inch) cube at the end of cable that is normally four feet long, but other custom lengths are available. Each axis reads negative when pointing toward the south pole of a magnet and positive toward north.</p>
<p>At fixed temperature, reproducibility is +/- 0.01 milligauss (1 nT) and the temperature coefficient of the offset is less than 0.01 milligauss/ °C. The temperature coefficient for gain is less than .0015%/ °C. As shipped, gain accuracy is +/-0.5% and the meter offset is +/- 0.5 milligauss with all offset knobs set at zero.  All specifications are at temperatures 0 to 45 °C. X,Y,Z are aligned with the cube edges to accuracy one degree unless you specify 1/10 degree in the drop-down box below.</p>
<p><strong>MGM3AXIS Output Jack Description:</strong></p>
<p>The outputs are an analog voltage, with 1 Volt = 1 Gauss +/- 0.5%. Range is +/- 2 gauss (= +/- 2V). Normally, it is a ""slow-moving"" DC voltage (valid DC to 3 Hz), but a higher bandwidth can be specified (DC to 300 Hz at the 3 dB point) at no extra cost.  The X, Y and Z outputs each has a separate BNC output with a single common ground.</p>",Pine Environmental,Equipment,"Esale, Radiation & EMF Meters, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54486,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1253.jpg?v=1592516009,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

dexsil_petroflag_tph_analyzer_system,Dexsil PetroFLAG TPH Analyzer System,"<p>Relying on laboratory methods to determine hydrocarbon contamination in soil is both time consuming and expensive.  Laboratory methods, such as EPA Method 8015, are very expensive and have turnaround times of one to two weeks.</p>
<p>Most samples analyzed by this method limit the results to Gasoline Range Organics (GRO) or Diesel Range Organics (DRO).  When limiting the analysis to these two ranges, heavier fractions of hydrocarbons such as fuel oil, motor oil, hydraulic oil, gear oil, transformer oil and greases are ""not seen"" in the analysis and the soil samples are reported as clean even though these heavier hydrocarbons still exist in the soil.</p>
<p>Method 418.1 was the only broad spectrum ""Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon"" field test for soil. Although this test is quite accurate for dry soils, the extraction efficiencies for wet soil can be as low 10%.  This inability to solvate wet soil samples can lead to false negative results.  Method 418.1 also uses a chlorinated solvent (Freon) as its extraction solvent. Freon is environmentally unsafe, and its disposal costs are quite high.</p>
<p>The analyst now has another choice; an environmentally safe, inexpensive, field portable test called PetroFLAG. The PetroFLAG system is a field portable method for the determination of total petroleum hydrocarbons in soil.  It is both safe and easy to use. PetroFLAG does not distinguish between aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, but quantifies all fuels, oils, and greases as total hydrocarbons.  Analysis of a 10 gram soil sample is performed using three simple steps: extraction, filtration, and analysis.</p>
<p>The PetroFLAG system is completely field portable.  Everything needed to perform ten soil tests can be conveniently carried to the job site in a briefcase size carrying case.  The PetroFLAG meter is a light-weight, rugged hand-held unit powered by a 9-volt alkaline battery.  The meter is menu driven for ease of use and utilizes an EEPROM memory system. </p>
<p>Fifteen response factors are built into the analyzer depending on the analyte of interest.  Response factors correlate to fuels ranging from weathered gasoline to heavy crude oil.  The results are shown in ppm on an LCD display screen.</p>",Pine Environmental,Equipment,"Esale, Rental, Soil Analysis, Soil Sampling",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'51615,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1220.jpg?v=1592515981,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active
oil_in_soil_kit,Oil in Soil Kit,"<p>The OIL-IN-SOIL™ field screening test kit is an inexpensive, simple and rapid qualitative sampling test for identifying the presence of hydrocarbons including LNAPLs and DNAPLs in soil. The OIL-IN-SOIL™ test kit is a visually enhanced version of the old Soil-Water Shake Test for the presence of oils and petroleum products. Users add soil to a line on the label, add water to another line on the label and shake the jar to release the dyes. The Kit comes in 3 colors: One kit uses the original SUDAN IV which colors the hydrocarbon red. The OIL-IN-SOIL™ Kits also comes in a Royal Blue color called OIL-IN-SOIL™RB . A colored ring or spots indicates the presence of oil or petroleum at above 2,500 ppm.TPH). A Styrofoam ball turning pink or light blue, depending on the dye used will indicate hydrocarbon down to 500 ppm. Many DNAPLs will give indications below 10 ppm because of their ability to penetrate the styrene use din the jar.</p>
<p><u><strong>Application:</strong></u><br> The OIL-IN-SOIL™ field screening test kits are useful tools for reducing the cost of Phase I and Phase II site assessments, by reducing the time and costs associated with delineating the perimeter, depth and direction of spills in soil. They are also often used with core samples to identify organic substances.</p>
<p><u><strong>Environmental Benefits:</strong></u><br> Rapid delineation of hydrocarbons and DNAPL spill boundaries in soil, results in more rapid removal of contaminants from the environment. The OIL-IN-SOIL™ kit uses a deminimus quantity of Sudan IV which is encapsulated in a soluble cube - thus decreasing the hazards to the test user from airborne particulate Sudan IV and overcoming the problems associated with disposal of larger quantities of a mutagenic dye. We have recently switched to a new manufacturer whose dye is non mutagenic.</p>
<p><strong><u>Performance:</u></strong><br> The OIL-IN-SOIL™ kits provide an inexpensive, consistent tool for the detection of hydrocarbons (+- 500 ppm TPH) in soil. They are easy to use and require minimal training - thus reducing the need for ongoing expensive technical support on site. The OIL-IN-SOIL™ kits have been sold commercially for several years and are used for Phase I and Phase II site assessments by most major environmental companies and several utility companies throughout the USA .</p>

pearpoint_p350_flexitrax_inspection_system,Pearpoint P350 flexitrax Inspection System,"<p>	The P350 flexitrax™ offers inspection professionals the ultimate portable crawler system. This advanced and affordable system features the simplicity and transportability of a pushrod system whilst delivering the functionality and performance associated with complex and expensive crawler systems. The P350 is a modular system, designed to meet the tough requirements of any inspection environment.</p><p>	<br>	<span style='""font-size:14px;""'><u><strong>Outstanding picture quality</strong></u></span></p><p>	The P350 flexitrax features ultra-bright LEDs and high-resolution cameras built on a powerful digital video platform. The P350 flexitrax system supports three interchangeable, high-resolution cameras. Each camera features ultra-bright white LEDs that ensure a clear picture and a long, maintenance-free life. The digital video is displayed on the command module's ultra-bright, 8"" industrial grade TFT screen. The P350 flexitrax command module allows you to zoom and rotate photos and live or recorded digital video in real-time. The command module also provides Mimic™ display, an intuitive way of controlling pan and tilt. Combined, these features provide outstanding video picture quality and make it easier and quicker to correctly identify problems even in the toughest conditions.</p><p>	<span style='""font-size:14px;""'><u><strong>Reliability where you need it</strong></u></span></p><p>	The P350 flexitrax is engineered to operate in almost any environment. The command module and drum have a weatherproof rating of IP53. The tough, yet light-weight controller provides a durable buffer between the elements and your survey data. The command module stores survey data direct to solid-state Compact Flash cards. Solid-state non-volatile memory means there are no moving parts so your files are secure and less vulnerable to shock damage and power outages. The system is operable in the most demanding conditions. The crawlers can operate fully submersed and are water resistant to depths of up to 100m (330'). They are constructed from brass and stainless steel and are built with a single or twin 50W motor configuration, powerful enough to move through almost any pipeline system.The integrated sensitive inclinometer and the multi-frequency sonde allow you to map pipeline topography easily and efficiently. The ruggedly constructed cameras are designed to transfer any front impact to the crawler body, protecting the cameras from shock damage.</p><p>	<span style='""font-size:14px;""'><strong><u>Flexible digital data transfer</u></strong></span></p><p>	The advanced digital platform of the P350 flexitrax means you can transfer survey data from your Compact Flash card to your PC or laptop via fast USB 2.0. Use the included FlexiSight™ Windows-based software to edit video and convert reports to Microsoft ® Word format. With Bluetooth ® wireless technology you can send your inspection photos from the command module to a compatible cell phone and forward them instantly to your client.</p><p>	<span style='""font-size:14px;""'><strong><u>Versatility</u></strong></span></p><p>	The P350 flexitrax is small enough to fit in the trunk of your car. The system can be van or truck mounted and wheeled onsite using the ergonomic barrow design, allowing you to reach conduits beyond the range of your vehicle. Once onsite, the system is quick and easy to set-up and deploy. Build the system to meet your inspection requirements. Choose between a practical and inexpensive manual drum system or an advanced, compact, self-contained powered drum with up to 250m (825') of cable. Choose from three interchangeable cameras and two powerful, yet compact crawlers that are designed to withstand the most challenging sub-surface conditions.<br>	<br>	The command module is also fully compatible with the P330+ flexiprobe™ giving you access to its comprehensive range of pushrod reels, cameras and accessories. Switch from crawler to pushrod inspection without carrying a second system. The system is easy to use, thanks to its intuitive user interface and simple, one-touch control over video and photo capturing. The tough and durable keypad gives you direct access to advanced digital features and lets you drive any drum, crawler and camera combination. The command module and the drum also feature RCA video outputs, meaning you can record your video to an external device or display video on an external monitor. Each crawler ships with one set of small wheels. The small wheel set is the optimal choice for deployment in 100mm (4"",) pipes for the P354 crawler and in 150mm (6"",) pipes for the P356 crawler. For bigger pipes there is an option of different wheel configurations and elevators.</p><p>	<span style='""font-size:14px;""'><u><strong>Serviceability</strong></u></span></p><p>	The P350 flexitrax system is designed and built for continuous operation and easy maintenance. Each crawler is designed for quick repair. The powered drum features a removable drum and cable cassette that's fast and easy to replace in the workshop or even in the field. The optional re-termination kit makes it easy and affordable to replace and repair damaged cables. The P350 flexitrax system is the clear choice when you need cost-effective and flexible solutions.</p><p>	<span style='""font-size:14px;""'><u><strong>Digital control</strong></u></span></p><ul>	<li>		Compact and tough controller can be left on the drum or fitted where convenient</li>	<li>		Ultra-bright 8"" industrial grade TFT screen with anti-reflective protection offers the best picture in any light condition</li>	<li>		Tough and durable keypad to control all the system functions and movements</li>	<li>		Splashproof keyboard for text entry and report writing</li>	<li>		Digital zoom and picture navigation functions to explore, in real-time, the live video picture</li>	<li>		Record full SVGA video and snapshots onto solid-state Compact Flash (CF) card</li>	<li>		Bluetooth ® wireless technology to send photos world-wide instantly (using a compatible cell phone and service provider)</li>	<li>		USB 2.0 port to transfer all the files quickly to a PC or laptop</li>	<li>		Compatible with P330+ flexiprobe pushrod system</li>

wildco_stainless_steel_hand_corer,Wildco Ogeechee Core Sampler,"<p><span>Wildco® Ogeechee™ corers are designed to be lowered on a taut line or cable into the substrate. They are not designed to be dropped because they are top-heavy and can tip over. Wherever you can wade, float, or find a dock, you can use the Wildco® hand corer! Here is a low-cost, foolproof sampler especially intended for shallow coring in fresh, salt or brackish waters. Use is simplicity itself: merely push it into bottom sediments using handles on the head assembly. After the corer penetrates the bottom, twist or pulls it free to retrieve your sample. In deeper water, you can attach a 5 - 15 foot long extension handle to the head. In deeper water yet, you can drop it by attaching a line to a clevis located on the head assembly between the handles. The hand corer works by creating a partial vacuum which holds the sample in place and helps prevent washout.

frog_4000_voc_analyzer,FROG-4000 VOC Analyzer,"<p>Defiant Technologies' FROG-4000TM is a hand held micro system for detection of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in water, air, and soil.</p>
<p>The FROG-4000TM miniaturizes components used for analytical chemistry. The system incorporates a micro preconcentrator that is coated with a designer nanoporous material. The micro preconcentrator has an integrated heater for thermal desorption. Defiant's micro GC separates target analytes in less than 5 minutes. The micro GC column also has an integrated heater for temperature ramp chromatography. Ramping the temperature reduces the analysis time and aids in the separation of late eluting compounds. The detector is a miniature PID (10.6 eV). Chemical name and concentration can be viewed on FROG-4000's LCD display, or the user may watch the chromatogram real time on a computer.   FROG-4000TM includes a micro-SD card to store results from the field. Data can be downloaded from the SD card for further analysis at a later time.</p>

global_water_wq770_turbidity_meter,Global Water WQ770 Turbidity Meter,"<h3>	Turbidity Sensor</h3><p>	Global Water's Turbidity Sensor is a highly accurate submersible instrument for in-situ environmental or process monitoring. Applications include: water quality testing and management, river monitoring, stream measurement, reservoir water quality testing, groundwater testing, water and wastewater treatment, and effluent and industrial control.</p><p>	In accordance with USEPA Method 180.1 for turbidity measurement, the Turbidity Sensor is a 90 degree scatter nephelometer. The sensor directs a focused beam into the monitored water. The light beam reflects off particles in the water, and the resultant light intensity is measured by a photodetector positioned at 90 degrees to the light beam. The detected light intensity is directly proportional to the turbidity of the water. The turbidity sensor utilizes a second light detector to correct for light intensity variations, color changes, and minor lens fouling.</p><h3>	Turbidity Meter</h3><p>	The Global Water Turbidity Meter combines the turbidity sensor (described above) with a handheld meter that has a six digit LED screen, 4-button control panel, and an internal 9V battery. The handheld portable water meter can be used for enivronmental or process sites that do not require permanent monitoring. The meter will display readings directly in either nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) or parts per million (PPM). The meter also includes an automatic shutoff feature to conserve battery power.</p>",Pine Environmental,Equipment,"Esale, Rental, Turbidity Meters",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'55486,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1782.jpg?v=1592515891,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active
wl650_sonic_water_level_meter,WL650 Sonic Water Level Meter,"<p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><b>Sonic Water Level Meter Product Description</b></font></p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'>Global Water's WL650 Sonic Water Level Meter is a self-contained, battery operated meter that uses sound waves to measure well water level.   Fast, accurate measurements are possible in the field or anywhere without the use of down-hole water level meters.   The Sonic Water Level Meters are lightweight, compact, versatile, and easy to operate.</font></p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'>The water level meter allows you to measure crooked wells, wells with cascading water, partially cased rock wells, wells with submersible pumps, capped or uncapped wells, wells with pipes and wires inside, in fact you can even measure the length of coiled pipe with the water level meter.   As long as the obstructions take up no more than half of the bore area the meter will not suffer any loss of accuracy.   The sonic water level meter should only be used on wells under 10 inches in diameter as the accuracy decreases with larger diameter wells.</font></p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><b>Sonic Water Level Meter Operation</b></font></font></p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'>The WL650 Sonic Water Level Meter is simple to operate.   Select either the NORMAL (10-500 feet) or DEEP (200 to 1,200 feet) setting on the DEPTH switch.   Then, to measure a capped well, simply insert the duct into the 5/8 inch wide access port and push the power-on switch.   In a few seconds the water level will appear on the water level meter's digital display.   In the NORMAL setting, the sonic water level meter stays activated for 5 seconds or 5 pings.   Using the DEEP mode, the water level meter emits 4 pings in 16 seconds.   For more measuring time, hold the sonic water level meter's switch down as long as necessary.</font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><b>Ignore distance feature</b><br>	The factory distance default values for the sonic water level meter are 10 ft ( 3 meters) in Normal mode and 200 ft (60 meters) in Deep mode.   If problems occur due to reflections from liners that don't come all the way to the top of the casing or unwanted signal returns from such things as pitless adaptors and such that interfere with getting a proper reading the water level meter's default values can be increased so that returns within that distance are ignored.   Also, if you are making draw-down measurements that require the use of the sonic water level meter's deep mode but you wish to be able to measure to less than 200 ft (60 meters) you can reduce the minimum distance accordingly so that you don't have to switch modes during the test.</font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'>For uncapped wells, use the provided cover plate, which slips onto the measuring duct and provides a seal for up to 6-inch diameter casings.   Cover plates for larger diameters can be easily fabricated from plastic or metal sheet. </font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><b>Gain/Sensitivity - ''Which Gain Setting to Use, Fixed or Variable?''</b><br>	The Variable gain mode provides, in effect, a rising gain or sensitivity with time.   This method gives greater weight to return signals that occur later in the measurement cycle and is beneficial on deeper wells where the return signal is more attenuated.   This also makes the units less susceptible to unwanted returns from various surfaces in the well casing that might interfere with a proper measurement.</font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'>The Variable gain mode is somewhat more susceptible to interference from pump noise or other sources of high ambient noise.   Also, in some specific configurations it is possible for the unit to favor a secondary return over the primary one and give a reading that is twice the actual water level.</font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'>The Fixed mode is less susceptible to interference from ambient noise and the secondary return problem.   This mode can be used to advantage in such cases.   Some sensitivity is sacrificed so the unit might not read the deepest water levels in this mode.</font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><b>Temperature Control</b><br>	Obtaining an accurate measurement with the sonic water level meter requires that the temperature setting on the meter be equal to the average air temperature inside the well casing.   The temperature setting corrects for the variation of the velocity of sound with the air temperature in the well bore.   The sonic water level meter's temperature toggle switch adjusts the temperature setting for the variation of sound velocity in the well casing.   The value set shows on the display and is retained until changed.</font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'>The correct temperature setting can be determined by using the TEMPERATURE MAP TABLE provided with the water level meter for the state where the meter will be used (temperature settings are provided for all states in the United States).   Alternatively, the reverse side of the map table has a LOOK-UP TABLE giving the setting if the well water and average monthly surface temperatures are known.</font></p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><i>Please note: The outside or ambient air temperature does not affect the water level meter operation, provided the meter and its components remain within the operating temperature range.</i></font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><b><font color='""""' face='""""'>Sonic Water Level Meter Specifications</font></b></font></p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><i>Measurement range:</i> Normal 10-500 ft (3-152 m), Deep 200-1200 ft (61-366 m)<br>	<i>Display resolution:</i> 0.1 ft<br>	<i>Measurement accuracy:</i> </font></p>",Pine Environmental,Equipment,"Esale, Rental, Water Level Meters",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'51733,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1781.jpg?v=1592515890,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active
global_water_wl-15x_water_level_logger,Global Water WL-15X Water Level Logger,"<p>	Global Water's WL15X Water Level Logger provides a datalogger with a submersible pressure transducer for remote monitoring and recording of well depth measurements and water pressure data. This highly reliable and accurate water level recorder records 24,400 readings and is programmable from one reading per second to one reading per day. Ranges of 0-3', 0-15', 0-30', 0-60', 0-120' and 0-250' are available. A 25' cable is standard, and optional cable lengths are available up to 500'.</p><p>	The Water Level Recorder's datalogger is housed in a weather-resistant cylindrical enclosure that can slip inside a 2-inch pipe. The data recorder is easily adapted with standard hardware for well head mounting or other installations. The datalogger enclosure also houses an easily replaceable 9 VDC battery, which powers the Water Level Logger and level sensor for one year. Purchase of the WL15X includes Windows-based datalogging software, which allows easy upload of recorded data to standard spreadsheet programs on a PC computer.</p><p>	The Water Level Logger's level sensor is fully encapsulated with marine-grade epoxy so that moisture can never leak in or work its way down the vent tube to cause drift or level sensor failure (as is the case with other pressure sensors). The submersible pressure transducer uses a unique, highly flexible silicon diaphragm to interface between water and the sensing element. This silicon diaphragm protects the level sensor's electronics from moisture and provides a submersible water level transducer with exceptional linearity and very low hysteresis. The design of Global Water's water level sensor eliminates the issues associated with metal foil diaphragms, which tend to crinkle and stretch out over time causing drift, linearity, and hysteresis problems. The water level sensor is also protected by a stainless steel micro-screen cap, which makes fouling with silt, mud, or sludge virtually impossible.</p>",Pine Environmental,Equipment,"Esale, Rental, Water Level Meters",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1779.jpg?v=1592515889,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

The pump consists of a riser tube with a one-way valve at the foot and a surface pumping mechanism.</p>
<p>The valve allows water to enter the tubing as it is pushed downwards, and retains the water when the tube is pulled upwards again. The inertia of the water itself provides the force to carry it up to the surface whenever the tube is being pumped up and down. The water travels in a continuous column, with little disturbance, thus retaining volatiles.</p>

isco_1640_liquid_level_actuator,Isco 1640 Liquid Level Actuator,"<p>The 1640 Liquid Level Actuator provides a simple, reliable way to trigger an Isco sampler to begin a sampling routine when the liquid level reaches a predetermined height. The 1640 comprises a conductivity probe that mounts above the stream, a control box that mounts on the sampler, and connecting cable. It can be used in conjunction with other devices such as a rain gauge or flow meter to trigger sampling on multiple conditions.<br> <br> With the control switch set to LATCH, the 1640 will actuate the sampler when the liquid rises to the probe assembly, and the sampler remains actuated when the liquid level recedes. In TOGGLE/RESET mode, the 1640 actuates the sampler only while the liquid is touching the probe, and sampling is suspended if the liquid level recedes.</p>",Pine Environmental,Equipment,"Composite Samplers, Esale, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54663,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1732.jpg?v=1592515826,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active
isco_750_area_velocity_flow_module,Isco 750 Area Velocity Flow Module,"<p>The sensor on the 750 module uses patented Doppler technology to directly measure average velocity in the flow stream. An integral pressure transducer measures liquid depth to determine flow area. The 6712 sampler then calculates flow rate by multiplying the area of the flow stream by its average velocity.<br> <br> The 750 gives you greater accuracy in applications where weirs or flumes are not practical, or where submerged, full pipe, surcharged and reverse flow conditions may occur. With area velocity you don't have to estimate the slope and roughness of the channel. And Isco's exclusive 500 kHz Doppler penetrates farther into deep flow streams than 1 MHz systems, whose shorter wavelength can cause them to give ""nearsighted"", velocity measurement in typical wastewater applications. The Doppler system continuously profiles the flow stream, eliminating profiling and calibration required by electromagnetic systems.</p>",Pine Environmental,Equipment,"Composite Samplers, Esale, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'51785,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1731.jpg?v=1592515824,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

Some of the most advanced capabilities available are incorporated into this portable meter. Designed for intuitive operation, the menu-driven navigation is user-friendly and logical. A backlit 128 x 64 pixels graphic LCD, that automatically sizes the digits, allows full configuration of each measured parameter, displays on-screen graphing and has options for units and language selections, provides high-quality resolution and sophistication that is unsurpassed in its class.</p><p>	Engineered with smart features such as auto recognition of pH/ORP probe, auto-ranging adjustments for EC/TDS readings, and measurement check - to eliminate erroneous readings - and more, our design actually simplifies operations and handling. There is virtually no learning curve to getting into this meter and quickly mastering it's capabilities. Each parameter is fully supported by the on-screen contextual HELP function, which is active during measurement and calibration modes. For field applications, Hanna's Quick Calibration allows the user to standardize pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen, all with one solution! While in calibration mode, the meter will also assess and verify probe functionality. For monitoring and recording data, HI 9828 can be equipped with the optional T.I.S. - Tag Identification System: iButton ©s with unique ID numbers. Installed at any sampling site, these tags will record and match specific location information with logging data. Comprehensive GLP features, such as last calibration date and status information, calibration time-out, and date and time tags associated with sample measurements, ensure consistency and accountability. The LOGGER function memorizes data from each connected sensors and log-on-demand &amp; automatic logging can record up to 60,000 data samples. All data is downloadable to a PC via USB connectivity.</p><p>	HI 9828 is designed for demanding outdoor environments. The meter is impact resistant and waterproof to IP67 standards (30 minutes immersion under 1 m of water), and the multi-sensor probe, HI 769828, with an IP68 rating, can be left underwater for an extended period of time. This intelligent probe contains a built-in microprocessor with amplifiers, interprets the high impedance signals from each sensor and sends the converted data to the meter. Consequently, common tolerance issues associated with high impedance signals, such as limiting cable length, and noise interferences are eliminated. The probe maintains reliable communication with the meter, and the user is warned of any problems, such as a broken cable line.</p><p>	Five out of six measured parameters are housed in the probe: pH/pH mV, ORP, EC, % saturation and mg/L (ppm) oxygen and temperature. Each sensor is independently replaceable, and easy to maintain &amp; clean. The sensors are protected by a rugged outer PVC/stainless steel sleeve, the design of which is suited for use in 2'' wells. The intact probe housing is rated to IP68. Standard cable lengths are 4, 10 and 20 meters and custom lengths are available upon request. The galvanic DO sensor has a built-in thermistor to provide fast temperature corrected readings. Of course, there is no polarization time for this sensor, so it is ready for measurement at a moment's notice. For EC, a 4-ring conductivity system ensures stable readings that are immune to polarization and the buffering effect of surface coating. Absolute conductivity, temperature corrected conductivity, salinity, specific gravity and TDS determinations are possible with measurements from this sensor. The meter automatically recognizes the presence of either the pH or pH/ORP sensor. Both sensors have a cloth junction which allows greater sensitivity, and are gel-filled for improved resistance to contamination. The meter also displays pH/mV readings, ideal for trouble-shooting.

gilian_gilair_air_sampling_pump,Gilian GilAir Air Sampling Pump,"<p>	A GILIAN Personal Air Sampling System is worn by a worker during the work shift to determine exposure to ambient particulates, gases, or vapors. It draws a carefully controlled volume of air and contaminants through collection media over the period. The media is then sent to a laboratory for analysis, resulting in a calculated level of exposure.</p><h3>	Automatic Constant Flow</h3><p>	This is the most important feature of any sampling pump, and is standard on all GILIANÃ‚ ® Pump models (except BDX-II). It assures pulsation-free flow is maintained within Ã‚ ±5% of the initial set point, even with varying back pressures from flow restrictions or buildup of material on the filter.</p><h3>	Battery LED</h3><p>	These lights tell you when the battery pack is fully charged, assuring a minimum of 8 hours of service over the operating range.</p><h3>	Clock/Programmable Timer</h3><p>	Clock pump models have a digital display with elapsed time, including a Run/Hold function to pause and resume sampling. This option is available for all GILIANÃ‚ ® pump models except BDX-II.</p><p>	Another option available on most models is a programmable timer which can be used to start or stop the pump at preset time intervals or to program a delayed start.</p><h3>	Built-In Rotameter</h3><p>	A rotameter with graduated LPM scale is standard on all models except LFS-113 and GilAir II, giving you an easy way to visually inspect to make sure the pump is maintaining the required flow rate throughout the sampling period.</p><h3>	Instant Fault Function</h3><p>	The fault light indicator is activated when the pump attempts to operate outside Ã‚ ±5% of the required flow rate, such as from low battery, blocked tubing or filter, or other severe flow restriction. If fault condition persists for 30-60 seconds, pump automatically shuts down and freezes the timer. Units with timer display preserve run time on the display, ensuring a valid sampling result. If fault condition is cleared before shutdown, the pump resumes normal sampling and fault light goes out. GILIAN Pumps offer this fault feature while in constant low flow mode.</p><h3>	Anti-Tamper Control Cover</h3><p>	A cover plate is set in place over the control panel with a single screw, protecting flow control settings and off-on switch from inadvertently being changed during sampling period.</p><h3>	Low Flow Module With Constant Flow Control</h3><p>	These modules can be quickly added to most high flow GILAIR pumps to adapt them to the lower flow rates required for sorbent tube sampling. Also available is a multiflow low flow module, which maintains constant pressure and allows sampling with multiple sorbent tubes, each with an independently set flow rate.</p><h3>	Both suction and discharge sampling</h3><p>	This feature makes pump suitable not only for conventional pull-through sampling media but also for bag sampling and other pressure applications.</p><h3>	See-Through Inlet Filter Housing</h3><p>	This feature protects pump from dirt and debris and is externally mounted on the pump, making it easy to visually inspect the filter. Filter replacement requires the removal of just four screws. Built-in moisture trap helps prevent moisture from entering and damaging the pump chamber, such as moisture carryover from impingers.</p><h3>	One Year Warranty</h3><p>	Twelve month warranty is standard, guaranteeing all pumps against any defects in parts and/or workmanship.</p><h3>	Rechargeable NiCad Battery Packs</h3><p>	These sealed battery packs provide approximately 8 to 10 hours of reliable operation on a single charge. They may be charged in place on the pump or easily detached for separate charging or for quick field change in a safe area. Packs are intrinsically safe, as they are UL listed. They include a current limit circuit for explosion protection.</p><h3>	Stainless steel belt clip</h3><p>	Clip is extra wide to provide maximum comfort to wearer and prevent the pump from tilting.</p><h3>	EMI/RFI Protection</h3><p>	This shielding helps to make sure ambient radio and electromagnetic interference from plant operations donÃ¢â‚¬™t affect the pumpÃ¢â‚¬™s flow control and timer circuit functions, degrading the accuracy of your sampling.</p>",Gilian,Equipment,"Air Sampling Pumps, Esale, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1710.jpg?v=1592515800,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

One example: stainless steel in Well Wizard pumps is electropolished to passivate the surface, delivering years more corrosion resistance than competitors' models.</p><p>	Pneumatic bladder pumps operate with a unique, gentle action ideal for low-flow sampling. Timed on/off cycles of compressed air alternately squeeze the flexible bladder to displace water out of the pump, and release it to allow the pump to refill by submergence, without creating any disturbance that could affect sample chemistry. Bladder pumps run easily at low rates for extended times, without the problems of other devices.</p><ul>	<li>		No overheating of high-speed electric pump motors, which can alter samples and ruin the pumps.</li>	<li>		No churning action, like that of bailers or inertial-lift samplers that increase turbidity.</li>	<li>		No suction to cause degassing of dissolved volatile contaminants.</li>
</ul><p>	The bladder prevents contact between the pump drive air and the sample, and the downwell equipment is permanently dedicated to each well, so both samples and the well are protected from disturbance or the danger of cross-well contamination.</p><p>	Well Wizard bladder pumps are part of the complete MicroPurge equipment system for low flow sampling, engineered for easy installation and use. QED application specialists will help specify the most effective, economical pumps and accessories for your site.</p><p>	Each pump is cleaned and laboratory-certified to be free of volatile organic compounds, acid extractable and base neutral contaminants. Your system is preassembled, with tubing cut to length, ready to install.</p><p>	If desired, installation by OSHA-certified field technicians is available. QED customer support -- with trained local representatives, 24-hour toll-free hotline, and next-day loaners or service turnaround when nee ded -- backs you with unmatched expertise and service.</p><p>	More MicroPurge dedicated sampling systems and pumps have been chosen since 1982 than all other manufacturers' equipment combined.</p><p>	To find out why, call QED today for a Low-Flow Data Sheet and site-specific cost analysis.</p>",QED,Equipment,"Bladder Pumps & Controllers, Esale, Ground Water Sampling, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,54742/61223,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1755.jpg?v=1592515798,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

solinst_discrete_interval_sampler_model_425,Solinst Discrete Interval Sampler Model 425,"<p>	Discrete interval sampling is ideal for obtaining truly representative water samples from below floating product layers (LNAPL) and for obtaining samples of product itself (LNAPL and DNAPL).</p><p>	It is also used to profile open bodies of water, open boreholes and screened wells, and to collect samples from distinct levels or points of inflow.</p><p>	There is negligible disturbance as can be caused by pumping and purging. Mixing of water from different levels in the well is minimized.</p><p>	Purging and disposal of purged water can be avoided. Sampling directly from a specific depth results in the collection of water which is most representative of the groundwater outside of the well at that depth.</p><div>	<strong>Discrete interval sampler</strong>
</div><p>	The Solinst Model 425 is a stainless steel sampler, with LDPE tubing mounted on the convenient Solinst reel. The reel has a pressure attachment for the high pressure hand pump, and a pressure/vent switch which is used to apply and release the pressure on the sampler. A sample release device is included with each Discrete Interval Sampler.</p><p>	The sampler is pressurized using a high pressure hand pump before being lowered into the well to prevent water flowing into the sampler on the way down the well. Once the desired depth is reached, the pressure is released and hydrostatic pressure fills the sampler with water directly from the sampling zone. A floating checkball inside the 1.66?›ƒ?ª?� sampler prevents water from entering the tubing, thus avoiding the need to decontaminate the tubing.</p><p>	When the sampler is filled, it can be repressurized and raised to the surface. The sample is decanted using the sample release device, which regulates flow and minimizes degassing of the sample.</p><p>	The sampler is ideal for groundwater sampling from below an oil/product layer on the surface of the water, as it allows a sample to be obtained which is untouched by the oil. The sampler is easily disassembled for decontamination.</p><div>	<strong>Applications</strong>
</div><ul>	<li>		Obtaining a representative groundwater sample from below oil/product layers</li>	<li>		Discrete interval sampling in lakes, rivers and wells</li>	<li>		Chemical profiling of wells</li>	<li>		Sampling at points of inflow to well</li>	<li>		LNAPL and DNAPL sampling</li>
</ul><div>	<strong>Voc sampling</strong>
</div><p>	Discrete interval samplers (DIS) are excellent for VOC sampling. There is no mixing with water from different levels in the well. The sample does not travel through a long length of tubing, risking loss of volatile organics. The sample has minimal contact with air.</p><p>	For the most accurate VOC results, the Model 425T Transportable DIS can be used. It retains the volatiles at down-hole conditions with zero headspace during retrieval and transport to the laboratory.</p><div>	<strong>Advantages</strong>
</div><ul>	<li>		High quality samples</li>	<li>		Sample has not been pumped through tubing</li>	<li>		No mixing of water from different levels</li>	<li>		Minimal disturbance of the water</li>	<li>		Easy disassembly for decontamination</li>	<li>		Avoids purging and disposal of purge water</li>	<li>		Easy operation and transportation</li>
</ul><div>	<strong>Materials</strong>
</div><p>	<strong>Samplers</strong> are constructed of stainless steel with Viton???? o-rings,FEP and polypropylene check balls.</p><p>	<strong>Tubing</strong> most commonly used is low density polyethylene (LDPE), however, FEP or FEP-lined polyethylene tubing is also available.

thermo_andersen_tsp_sampler,Thermo Andersen TSP Sampler,"<h3>TSP Mass Flow Controlled</h3>
<p>All Andersen High Volume Air Samplers feature accurate collection of total suspended particulates exceeding EPA specifications.  Air flow through a mass flow controlled system is maintained at a constant rate by an electronic probe which automatically adjusts the speed of the sampler to correct for variations in voltage temperature, pressure and filter loading.</p>
<p>Adjustable over a range from 20 SCFM to 60 SCFM the air flow is controlled at constant standard conditions of 25 degrees C temperature and 760 mm Hg pressure within plus or minus 1 SCFM.  By maintaining an exact air flow rate through the sampler, the average concentration measured is extremely accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>A typical Andersen TSP high volume air sampler incorporates a pressure recorder (G105) or a well-type manometer (G8WT) for flow verification. An elapsed time indicator (G901) is calibrated in hours, tenths, and hundredths meeting Federal Register specifications Vol 47 No. 234.  Andersen sampling systems simplify all phases of the sampling process. Initial calibration requires no disassembly of the system.</p>
<h3>TSP Volumetric Flow Contolled</h3>
<p>The Volumetric Flow Controller (VFC) is a dimensional venturi device used to control gas flow. When applied to a high volume air sampler, this flow control principal incorporates a smooth-wall venturi orifice that gradually opens to a recovery section. Vacuum is provided by a motor downstream of the venturi.</p>
<p>Over 95% of the energy lost in differential pressures across the restricting orifice is recovered in this design.</p>
<p>Flow control is accomplished by occluding or restricting and thus accelerating the air flow through the venturi.  At some point in the flow stream, the air velocity will equal the acoustic velocity or speed of sound, and critical flow will be achieved.  As long as downstream changes are small, all conditions at the venturi (including the flow rate) are determined by upstream conditions. This condition is referred to as</p>",Pine Environmental,Equipment,"Ambient High Volume Samplers, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'51112,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1691.jpg?v=1592515780,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

drager_tube_hand_pump,Drager Tube Accuro Hand Pump,"<p><strong><em>Mobile spot measurement</em></strong><br> This manual pump is used for spot measurements such as the detection of concentration peaks, confined space entry, worst-case scenarios etc.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sampling</strong></em><br> During the sampling process the substances to be evaluated are firstly accumulated on a suitable carrier material, e.g. activated charcoal, silica gel and so on. The air to be evaluated is thereby drawn over the respective material - with a predefined flow rate and duration. Afterwards, the substances that have accumulated on the carrier material through adsorption or chemisorption are examined qualitatively and quantitatively in the laboratory using instrumental analysis such as gas chromatography.</p>
<p><em><strong>Functional bellows pump</strong></em><br> The Drager-Tube pump accuro draws in 100 ml per stroke. When measuring, the pump body (bellows) is pressed together completely. The exhaust valve is closed during the opening phase of the bellows so that the gas sample flows through the connected Drager-Tube into the pump. After the complete opening of the pump body into its original position the suction process is finished. The end of stroke is visible by a pressure-controlled end of stroke indication, located in the pump head.</p>
<p><strong><em>One-handed operation</em></strong><br> Frequently, measurements need to take place under extreme conditions, e.g. on ladders, in shafts or when wearing heavy breathing protection.

casella_cel_633_sound_level_meter,Casella CEL-633A1 Sound Level Meter,"<p>The CEL-63x Series of sound level meters are the most versatile of meters available; ideal for both noise at work applications (ISO9612, OSHA) and environmental measurements (BS4142). Ensure compliance with workplace noise legislation with the CEL-633 and to assist with the selection of hearing protection.</p>
<p>The CEL-633 is an easy to use instrument designed to undertake the measurement requirements of the workplace and environmental noise. It also complies with the latest IEC and ANSI international standards for sound level meters. Just switch on the instrument, auto-calibrate and start measuring with one of the predefined views. Regardless of the view selected, all data is measured and stored simultaneously so no mistakes can be made.</p>
<p>By implementing the latest digital technology, the meter has a single measurement range so no range adjustment is required, ensuring the highest levels of performance with all noise sources. Models are available for both environmental and/or occupational noise with the availability of frequency analysis and advanced functions such as data markers, timers, and logging of time-history data. Even with such advanced functionality, the CEL-630 Series remains very simple to use.</p>
<p>Audio recording is a standard feature of the CEL-633, all models having a voice notes capability. This allows you to speak into the microphone before or after a measurement in order to annotate the result, so you don't need to write things down. Data can also be marked during a measurement to signify either an anomalous or significant event and audio is also recorded for later noise source identification.</p>
<p>If the instrument is used for unattended measurements, audio recording can be triggered by a condition such as a given level being exceeded for a period of time. In this case, additional data will be collected along with the audio. This can be especially useful where the noise source of interest is transient. The Type 1 microphone can be changed out.</p>",Casella CEL,Equipment,"Esale, Rental, Sound Level Meters",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54680,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1102.jpg?v=1592515700,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

thermo_450i,Thermo 450I,"<p>	Utilizing pulsed fluorescence technology the Model 450i H2S and SO2 analyzer operates on the principle that H2S can be converted to SO2. As the SO2 molecules absorb ultraviolet (UV) light and become excited at one wavelength, the molecules then decay to a lower energy state emitting UV light at a different wavelength. The pulsing of the U.V. source lamp serves to increase the optical intensity whereby a greater U.V. energy throughput and lower detectable SO2 concentration are realized.

dilution_probe_kit,Dilution Probe Kit,"<p>	Available to rent, the Thermo Scientific In-situ Dilution Probes,EPM 300 Series are designed for wet basis measurement using dilution extractive technology. The critical functions performed by the Series EPM 300 prepare the sample from the stack so that it can be accurately and precisely measured by the analyzer. Using an air-driven aspirator, the system extracts the sample from the stack. The sample then passes consecutively through a coarse filter, a fine particulate filter, and a glass or quartz critical orifice. Lastly, the sample is diluted with air from the aspirator, creating positive pressure in the sample line as it prepares for transport to the analyzer. This dilution process reduces the dew point of the stack gas to below that of the ambient air. The processed sample can then be transported to the analyzer up to 300 feet via an unheated sample line. (Heated sample lines may be required for low temperature applications.) In addition, a sample pump is not required for sample lines less than 300 feet which helps to reduce costs and increase up-time. The critical orifice determines the flow rate with which the sample is extracted from the stack. The EPM 300 Series offers a selection of three different orifice materials, including 7 glass, 5 quartz or 5 Monel orifices, all of which permit easy exchange to accommodate different dilution ratio requirements. The process of sample dilution, as utilized by the EPM 300 Series, promotes the filter longevity and reduces maintenance. In-Situ calibration is easy with the EPM 300 Series Probe. The calibration gas is supplied via the umbilical cord to the stack mounted probe. Then, calibration gas enters the probe and is diluted at the same dilution ratio as the sample from the stack. The calibration line is also used to provide blow back air to the coarse filter for cleaning purposes.</p>",Thermo Scientific,Equipment,"Data Acquisition Systems, Dilution & Calibrators, Esale, Rental",false,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54394,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1062.jpg?v=1592515565,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

qed_mp_bladder_pump,QED MP BLADDER PUMP,"<p>Forget about having to purge multiple well volumes before sampling, because with low-flow purging technology you can obtain accurate, precise samples with a reduction in purge volumes of up to 95 percent. Low-flow samples bypass stagnant, contaminated water in the well casing and exhibit reduced turbidity, minimized degassing and volatilization. In most cases, you won't have to filter samples before analysis. Low-flow sampling is approved in almost every state and EPA region. With the Sample Pro Consultant Kit, we offer a complete system for low-flow ground-water sampling specifically engineered for rugged field duty. The heart of the Kit is the MP10 MicroPurge Basics controller that revolutionizes sample pump flow control by making it simple, stable and repeatable. No overshooting, no flow rate fluctuation to disturb the well. An ID mode lets you recall a flow setting for the next sampling round. The Sample Pro pump was designed specifically for portable low-flow sampling.

<p>The Series 500 portable ozone gas monitor enables accurate real-time measurement of ozone in the air. Data is stored onboard the Series 500 with a maximum of 8,188 records available. To download the data a USB cable is supplied for connection to PC. Free PC software provided with the Series 500 takes the data and presents it in a chart or table view. Data can be downloaded and viewed in Excel.<br><br>The monitor can also operate in control mode. Upper and lower control limits can be easily set directly on the display. Using the 0-5V output the Series 500 analyzer can be used to switch on or off an externally connected device such as an ozone generator or system in the presence of a predetermined level of gas. By selecting the optional wall-mount bracket and plugging in mains power the Series 500 is effectively able to act as a fixed monitor as well as a handheld portable device.<br><br>Other features on the Series 500 include monitor ID and location ID. Monitor ID identifies the monitor uniquely and ensures that all data from it are tied to that monitor. Location ID can be used to tag measurements to a specific location which is helpful when sampling at a number of sites over the course of a day or week. High and low alarms can also be configured to alert when ozone concentrations have reached a user-defined set point.<br><br>For those wanting to recalibrate on-site, the Series 500 allows adjustment of zero and span. Together with the R42 Calibration Accessory and calibration gas, this function allows the sensor head to be fully recalibrated without having to return it to the factory. Alternatively, the sensor head can be returned to Aeroqual for a factory calibration which includes a renewed calibration certificate.</p>",Aeroqual,Equipment,"Coronavirus, COVID Equipment Rentals, COVID Equipment Sales, COVID-19, Indoor Air Quality, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54458,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,true,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0037/6635/3966/products/1435.jpg?v=1592515234,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

oil_in_soil_screening_kit,Oil in Soil Screening Kit,"<p>The OIL-IN-SOIL™ field screening test kit is an inexpensive, simple and rapid qualitative sampling test for identifying the presence of hydrocarbons including LNAPLs and DNAPLs in soil.  The OIL-IN-SOIL™ test kit is a visually enhanced version of the old Soil-Water Shake Test for the presence of oils and petroleum products.</p>
<p>Users add soil to a line on the label, add water to another line on the label and shake the jar to release the dyes.  The Kit comes in 3 colors: One kit uses the original SUDAN IV which colors the hydrocarbon red. The OIL-IN-SOIL™ Kits also come in a Royal Blue color called OIL-IN-SOIL™ RB.   A colored ring or spots indicates the presence of oil or petroleum at above 2,500 ppm. TPH.</p>
<p>A Styrofoam ball turning pink or light blue, depending on the dye used will indicate hydrocarbon down to 500 ppm. Many DNAPLs will give indications below 10 ppm because of their ability to penetrate the styrene used in the jar.</p>
<p><u><strong>Application:</strong></u><br> TOIL-IN-SOIL™™ field screening test kits are useful tools for reducing the cost of Phase I and Phase II site assessments, by reducing the time and costs associated with delineating the perimeter, depth and direction of spills in soil. They are also often used with core samples to identify organic substances.</p>
<p><u><strong>Environmental Benefits:</strong></u><br> Rapid delineation of hydrocarbons and DNAPL spill boundaries in soil, results in more rapid removal of contaminants from the environment.  The OIL-IN-SOIL™ kit uses a deminimus quantity of Sudan IV which is encapsulated in a soluble cube - thus decreasing the hazards to the test user from airborne particulate Sudan IV and overcoming the problems associated with disposal of larger quantities of a mutagenic dye.  We have recently switched to a new manufacturer whose dye is non mutagenic.</p>

eddyfi-ectane,Eddyfi Ectane,"<p>Eddyfi brings to the field a combination of power and functionality that has never been available before in such a small and light remote data acquisition unit. The Ectane™ is a new kind of no-compromise, high-performance inspection instrument with a strong bent on usability. Ectane is a field-ready multi-technology surface, heat exchanger (HX), and tube inspection instrument. In many ways, we believe that the Ectane redefines the potential of electromagnetic technologies for surface and tube NDT inspections.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><u><em><strong>Small and Light</strong></em></u><br>Key to the Ectane™ is the form factor and packaging. The instrument is compact, at roughly 610 in3 (10 liters). Its 100% magnesium alloy casing comes in at less than 15 lb (5.9 kg). with batteries and multiplexer. Such a light instrument does not need to be carried in a backpack or some kind of trolley; you can simply carry it in your hand.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><u><em><strong>Sealed Enclosure</strong></em></u><br>With its rugged and completely sealed enclosure, you can use the Ectane in the world's most inhospitable inspection environments, be it a nuclear contaminated area or a highly dusty environment.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><em><u><strong>Inspection Flexibility</strong></u></em><br>The Ectane provides new features that will add flexibility to your inspection programs. The plug-and-play connectivity of the instrument and the self-calibration tool can all help increase the productivity and general efficiency of your team. The instrument's two batteries can be used as your main source of power, or as backup power, should power from the outlet be interrupted during the acquisition. The remote control allows driving the acquisition sequence from a distance and also 1-man operation.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><u><em><strong>The SmartMUX™: an Integrated, Universal and Programmable Multiplexer</strong></em></u><br>With the Ectane, Eddyfi introduces the game-changing SmartMUX, a multiplexer that resides inside the instrument. Array probes now connect directly to the Ectane's single or double 160-pin connector. The SmartMUX is also programmable, to support any coil topology. You program it directly from a convenient software wizard. With such versatility, the Ectane allows users and probe designers alike to take advantage of any absolute, differential, or transmit-receive eddy current coil technology they want. The Ectane also expands the capacity of ECA to 256 elements. Modular by design, the instrument may be factory-retrofitted over time to increase channel capacity from 64 to 128 or 256 elements.</p>
<p>  Non</p>
<p><u><em><strong>Light, rugged, portable, and sealed</strong></em></u><br>Electromagnetic techniques such as RFT and MFL are used to inspect carbon steel and ferritic materials. The Ectane's low frequency and excellent bandwidth filter capabilities combined with software-specific RFT features and voltage planes ensure effective defect identification and assessment. The Ectane instrument and Magnifi™ C-scan views are designed to support emerging array technologies (eddy current, remote field, and magnetic flux) for tube inspections. Array technologies leverage the Ectane's 8 channels by multiplexing channel signals. Tube array probes that use the Ectane's SmartMUX, or are equipped with their own on-board multiplexer, can identify and characterize axial and circumferential flaws. Also, the internal rotating inspection system (IRIS) technique uses an ultrasonic beam to measure wall thickness. This Ectane option, combined with innovative probe turbine technology, can provide high sensitivity data that are critical to structural integrity assessments in heat exchangers.</p>
