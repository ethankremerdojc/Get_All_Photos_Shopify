wildco-kemmerer-sampler-6-2l,"Wildco Kemmerer Sampler, 6.2L","<p>Based on a 1927 design by Dr. George Kemmerer, University of Wisconsin, the Kemmerer bottle has long been favored by limnologists and ﬁshery biologists. With few moving parts and a simple trip, it offers trouble-free operation.</p>
<p>This series of versatile bottles are sized from 0.4 to 6.2 liters. All are constructed with corrosion-resistant stainless steel. Seals are made of silicone which is a better alternative to polyurethane in that silicone does not leach metal contaminants. Metal parts are 316 or 304 stainless steel except for fasteners and plastic-coated cables of 18-8 steel.<br><br>When running metal or any other chemical analysis, it is best to run a blank on the sampler prior to use.</p>
<p>Using Kemmerer Samplers<br>1. All-Angle™ trip heads lock the seals open before lowering into the water. In the open position, water flows smoothly around the bottom seal and into the cylinder, thereby obtaining an accurate and representative water sample to the milligram per liter (mg/L) level.<br>2.

cel-acoustic-calibrator-350,CEL Acoustic Calibrator 350,"<p>The CEL-350 dBadge Series is the first compact noise badge product to be designed with a display. This internal display makes it easy to perform calibration, provides status information and shows key measured data. The dBadge has a unique ‘fuel gauge’ to display memory and battery status, ensuring the exact remaining battery and memory capacity can be viewed on the display. Also a unique feature of the dBadge is the alarm function. An ultra-bright LED on the dBadge gives a visual indication of when exposure action levels have been exceeded by flashing at different rates. These action levels can be configured via the Insight software and used to instantly see if noise control or hearing protection measures are needed. The alarm function can be switched on or off via the dBadge keys. In addition to noise exposure parameters, the time history of the noise is logged in 1 minute values of both the average noise level and the peak value for subsequent analysis of how the noise exposure has occurred. This data can be viewed and analysed via Insight software.</p>",Casella CEL,Equipment,"Esale, product_upload_june_24, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'51421,68.0,,continue,manual,0.00,,true,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/cel-350-2-853x1280.jpg?v=1593118231,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,active

With flexible phased array technology, one probe is all you need to cover the full range of elbow diameters.<br>Pipe elbows are susceptible to damage, such as from flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC). However, inspecting them poses unique challenges. Because their surface shape changes from convex on the extrados (outside curve) to concave on the intrados (inside curve), and because many diameter standards exist, ultrasonic testing to evaluate damage in the elbow was limited to doing spot check thickness measurements using probes with small footprints.</p>

Measurements are logged and reported in real-time. The Dust Sentry Pro is configured to display and log particle mass by default. However, there is also an option to configure the instrument to record particle counts.<br><br>The particle counter uses scattered light to measure and count particles. Light from a laser diode is collimated to illuminate the aerosol sample flow. When a particle is present it scatters the incident laser light which is detected using a 60-degree solid angle elliptical mirror at right angles to the laser beam. The amount of scattered light is converted to a voltage pulse and the amplitude of the pulse is calibrated to a particle diameter. The particles are thus assigned on the basis of size to one of eight channels. An on-board temperature sensor corrects for thermal drift, and a sheath air filter keeps the optics clean even in harsh environments.<br><br><strong>Air monitoring software and communication</strong><br>The instrument includes an embedded PC, up to 20 years of onboard data storage, and two powerful software systems.

The size of a large suitcase it can measure up to 20 different gaseous and particulate pollutants and environmental parameters simultaneously. The AQM 65 offers the optimal balance between performance and price – measuring criteria pollutants to WHO air quality limits yet costing 3-5 x less than a traditional station based on analyzer technology.<br><br>With the AQM 65, you can continuously measure common air pollutants including ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds (VOC), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter (TSP, PM10, PM2.5, PM1), noise and meteorological parameters such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and direction.<br><br>Linked together in a network, and coupled with remote data acquisition, AQM 65s will form a lower cost, high-density ambient pollution monitoring system for a city or industrial perimeter. With near reference levels of performance, the AQM 65 ensures air quality data is reliable and robust and traceable back to recognized international standards e.g. USEPA (40 CFR Part 53) and EU (2008/50/EC).<br><br>The compact size has numerous advantages. The unit can be transported by car, carried by two people, and installed and operational in under 30 minutes. This makes deployment and relocation quick and easy. It also opens up monitoring locations that were previously inaccessible to traditional monitoring stations. Because the enclosure is small, the energy required for temperature control is much lower than for a traditional monitoring station. Lower power consumption opens up the possibility of a remote power supply and further decreases the total cost of ownership.<br><br>The modular design of the AQM 65 increases flexibility and makes maintenance and servicing easy. Order your AQM 65 with as many or as few sensors as you like – then purchase additional sensors when you need them. The sensors, packaged in modules, can be individually removed from the enclosure and sent away for servicing or simply swapped out for a new one. Such convenience decreases downtime and lowers the total cost of ownership. In a network, you can also move sensor modules from one monitoring location to another according to your needs.<br><br>Unlike other sensor-based instruments the AQM 65 is designed to be calibrated using standard calibration equipment used to calibrate ambient air quality analyzers. This ensures your measurements will be robust and traceable back to reference standards. We also offer calibration equipment specifically designed for the AQM 65 – the AirCal 1000 portable calibrator and the AirCal 8000 which comes fully integrated with your AQM 65 system.<br><br>The AQM 65 is supported by a global distribution network, meaning you’re never too far from a skilled technician ready to provide assistance and spare parts.

eddyfi-ectane,Eddyfi Ectane,"<p>Eddyfi brings to the field a combination of power and functionality that has never been available before in such a small and light remote data acquisition unit. The Ectane™ is a new kind of no-compromise, high-performance inspection instrument with a strong bent on usability. Ectane is a field-ready multi-technology surface, heat exchanger (HX), and tube inspection instrument. In many ways, we believe that the Ectane redefines the potential of electromagnetic technologies for surface and tube NDT inspections.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><u><em><strong>Small and Light</strong></em></u><br>Key to the Ectane™ is the form factor and packaging. The instrument is compact, at roughly 610 in3 (10 liters). Its 100% magnesium alloy casing comes in at less than 15 lb (5.9 kg). with batteries and multiplexer. Such a light instrument does not need to be carried in a backpack or some kind of trolley; you can simply carry it in your hand.</p>
<p><u><em><strong>Sealed Enclosure</strong></em></u><br>With its rugged and completely sealed enclosure, you can use the Ectane in the world's most inhospitable inspection environments, be it a nuclear contaminated area or a highly dusty environment.</p>
<p><em><u><strong>Inspection Flexibility</strong></u></em><br>The Ectane provides new features that will add flexibility to your inspection programs. The plug-and-play connectivity of the instrument and the self-calibration tool can all help increase the productivity and general efficiency of your team. The instrument's two batteries can be used as your main source of power, or as backup power, should power from the outlet be interrupted during the acquisition. The remote control allows driving the acquisition sequence from a distance and also 1-man operation.</p>
<p><u><em><strong>The SmartMUX™: an Integrated, Universal and Programmable Multiplexer</strong></em></u><br>With the Ectane, Eddyfi introduces the game-changing SmartMUX, a multiplexer that resides inside the instrument. Array probes now connect directly to the Ectane's single or double 160-pin connector. The SmartMUX is also programmable, to support any coil topology. You program it directly from a convenient software wizard. With such versatility, the Ectane allows users and probe designers alike to take advantage of any absolute, differential, or transmit-receive eddy current coil technology they want. The Ectane also expands the capacity of ECA to 256 elements. Modular by design, the instrument may be factory-retrofitted over time to increase channel capacity from 64 to 128 or 256 elements.</p>
<p><u><em><strong>Light, rugged, portable, and sealed</strong></em></u><br>Electromagnetic techniques such as RFT and MFL are used to inspect carbon steel and ferritic materials. The Ectane's low frequency and excellent bandwidth filter capabilities combined with software-specific RFT features and voltage planes ensure effective defect identification and assessment. The Ectane instrument and Magnifi™ C-scan views are designed to support emerging array technologies (eddy current, remote field, and magnetic flux) for tube inspections. Array technologies leverage the Ectane's 8 channels by multiplexing channel signals. Tube array probes that use the Ectane's SmartMUX, or are equipped with their own on-board multiplexer, can identify and characterize axial and circumferential flaws. Also, the internal rotating inspection system (IRIS) technique uses an ultrasonic beam to measure wall thickness. This Ectane option, combined with innovative probe turbine technology, can provide high sensitivity data that are critical to structural integrity assessments in heat exchangers.</p>

<p>The Series 500 portable ozone gas monitor enables accurate real-time measurement of ozone in the air. Data is stored onboard the Series 500 with a maximum of 8,188 records available. To download the data a USB cable is supplied for connection to PC. Free PC software provided with the Series 500 takes the data and presents it in a chart or table view. Data can be downloaded and viewed in Excel.<br><br>The monitor can also operate in control mode. Upper and lower control limits can be easily set directly on the display. Using the 0-5V output the Series 500 analyzer can be used to switch on or off an externally connected device such as an ozone generator or system in the presence of a predetermined level of gas. By selecting the optional wall-mount bracket and plugging in mains power the Series 500 is effectively able to act as a fixed monitor as well as a handheld portable device.<br><br>Other features on the Series 500 include monitor ID and location ID. Monitor ID identifies the monitor uniquely and ensures that all data from it are tied to that monitor. Location ID can be used to tag measurements to a specific location which is helpful when sampling at a number of sites over the course of a day or week. High and low alarms can also be configured to alert when ozone concentrations have reached a user-defined set point.<br><br>For those wanting to recalibrate on-site, the Series 500 allows adjustment of zero and span. Together with the R42 Calibration Accessory and calibration gas, this function allows the sensor head to be fully recalibrated without having to return it to the factory. Alternatively, the sensor head can be returned to Aeroqual for a factory calibration which includes a renewed calibration certificate.</p>",Aeroqual,Equipment,"Coronavirus, COVID Equipment Rentals, COVID Equipment Sales, COVID-19, homeFeatured, Indoor Air Quality, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54458,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,true,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/Series-500-Portable-Air-Quality-Monitor.png?v=1600440790,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

cai_602_dual_co2,California Analytical 602 CO2 Analyzer,"<p>The CAI 602 Dual CO2 analyzer is designed specifically for dilution systems in which CO2 needs to be measured in low ppm levels.  The analyzer uses a technique based on the infrared absorption characteristics of gases to measure concentration.</p>
<p>A single beam of infrared energy is modulated and passed through a sample cell containing the gas to be measured.  The beam emerges attenuated by the amount of energy absorbed by the gas in the sample.  Changes in the concentration of the gas results in changes in the intensity of the beam. </p>
<p>The remaining energy in the beam is passed serially through two cavities of an infrared detector containing the gas of interest and a mass flow sensor.  Changes in the intensity of the beam change the pressure differential between the cavities and consequently the balance of the electrical bridge in the detector circuit. Electronic processing of the imbalance of the signal is used to generate an electrical output signal proportional to the concentration of gas measured.</p>",California Analytical Instruments,Equipment,"Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Analyzers, Combustion Analysis, Esale, Rental, Source Analyzers",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54386,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/1414.jpg?v=1564635237,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

qed_mp_bladder_pump,QED MP BLADDER PUMP,"<p>Forget about having to purge multiple well volumes before sampling, because with low-flow purging technology you can obtain accurate, precise samples with a reduction in purge volumes of up to 95 percent. Low-flow samples bypass stagnant, contaminated water in the well casing and exhibit reduced turbidity, minimized degassing and volatilization. In most cases, you won't have to filter samples before analysis. Low-flow sampling is approved in almost every state and EPA region. With the Sample Pro Consultant Kit, we offer a complete system for low-flow ground-water sampling specifically engineered for rugged field duty. The heart of the Kit is the MP10 MicroPurge Basics controller that revolutionizes sample pump flow control by making it simple, stable and repeatable. No overshooting, no flow rate fluctuation to disturb the well. An ID mode lets you recall a flow setting for the next sampling round. The Sample Pro pump was designed specifically for portable low-flow sampling.

dilution_probe_kit,Dilution Probe Kit,"<p>	Available to rent, the Thermo Scientific In-situ Dilution Probes,EPM 300 Series are designed for wet basis measurement using dilution extractive technology. The critical functions performed by the Series EPM 300 prepare the sample from the stack so that it can be accurately and precisely measured by the analyzer. Using an air-driven aspirator, the system extracts the sample from the stack. The sample then passes consecutively through a coarse filter, a fine particulate filter, and a glass or quartz critical orifice. Lastly, the sample is diluted with air from the aspirator, creating positive pressure in the sample line as it prepares for transport to the analyzer. This dilution process reduces the dew point of the stack gas to below that of the ambient air. The processed sample can then be transported to the analyzer up to 300 feet via an unheated sample line. (Heated sample lines may be required for low temperature applications.) In addition, a sample pump is not required for sample lines less than 300 feet which helps to reduce costs and increase up-time. The critical orifice determines the flow rate with which the sample is extracted from the stack. The EPM 300 Series offers a selection of three different orifice materials, including 7 glass, 5 quartz or 5 Monel orifices, all of which permit easy exchange to accommodate different dilution ratio requirements. The process of sample dilution, as utilized by the EPM 300 Series, promotes the filter longevity and reduces maintenance. In-Situ calibration is easy with the EPM 300 Series Probe. The calibration gas is supplied via the umbilical cord to the stack mounted probe. Then, calibration gas enters the probe and is diluted at the same dilution ratio as the sample from the stack. The calibration line is also used to provide blow back air to the coarse filter for cleaning purposes.</p>",Thermo Scientific,Equipment,"Data Acquisition Systems, Dilution & Calibrators, Esale, Rental",false,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54394,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/1062.jpg?v=1564633278,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active
thermo_450i,Thermo 450I,"<p>	Utilizing pulsed fluorescence technology the Model 450i H2S and SO2 analyzer operates on the principle that H2S can be converted to SO2. As the SO2 molecules absorb ultraviolet (UV) light and become excited at one wavelength, the molecules then decay to a lower energy state emitting UV light at a different wavelength. The pulsing of the U.V. source lamp serves to increase the optical intensity whereby a greater U.V. energy throughput and lower detectable SO2 concentration are realized. Reflective bandpass filters, as compared to commonly used transmission filters, are less subject to photochemical degradation and are more selective in wavelength isolation. This results in both increased detection specificity and long term stability.This state-of-the-art gas analyzer also offers features such as an ethernet port as well as flash memory for increased data storage.

<p>Audio recording is a standard feature of the CEL-633, all models having a voice notes capability. This allows you to speak into the microphone before or after a measurement in order to annotate the result, so you don't need to write things down. Data can also be marked during a measurement to signify either an anomalous or significant event and audio is also recorded for later noise source identification.</p>
<p>If the instrument is used for unattended measurements, audio recording can be triggered by a condition such as a given level being exceeded for a period of time. In this case, additional data will be collected along with the audio. This can be especially useful where the noise source of interest is transient.

solinst_discrete_interval_sampler_model_425,Solinst Discrete Interval Sampler Model 425,"<p>	Discrete interval sampling is ideal for obtaining truly representative water samples from below floating product layers (LNAPL) and for obtaining samples of product itself (LNAPL and DNAPL).</p><p>	It is also used to profile open bodies of water, open boreholes and screened wells, and to collect samples from distinct levels or points of inflow.</p><p>	There is negligible disturbance as can be caused by pumping and purging. Mixing of water from different levels in the well is minimized.</p><p>	Purging and disposal of purged water can be avoided. Sampling directly from a specific depth results in the collection of water which is most representative of the groundwater outside of the well at that depth.</p><div>	<strong>Discrete interval sampler</strong>
</div><p>	The Solinst Model 425 is a stainless steel sampler, with LDPE tubing mounted on the convenient Solinst reel. The reel has a pressure attachment for the high pressure hand pump, and a pressure/vent switch which is used to apply and release the pressure on the sampler. A sample release device is included with each Discrete Interval Sampler.</p><p>	The sampler is pressurized using a high pressure hand pump before being lowered into the well to prevent water flowing into the sampler on the way down the well. Once the desired depth is reached, the pressure is released and hydrostatic pressure fills the sampler with water directly from the sampling zone. A floating checkball inside the 1.66?›ƒ?ª?� sampler prevents water from entering the tubing, thus avoiding the need to decontaminate the tubing.</p><p>	When the sampler is filled, it can be repressurized and raised to the surface. The sample is decanted using the sample release device, which regulates flow and minimizes degassing of the sample.</p><p>	The sampler is ideal for groundwater sampling from below an oil/product layer on the surface of the water, as it allows a sample to be obtained which is untouched by the oil. The sampler is easily disassembled for decontamination.</p><div>	<strong>Applications</strong>
</div><ul>	<li>		Obtaining a representative groundwater sample from below oil/product layers</li>	<li>		Discrete interval sampling in lakes, rivers and wells</li>	<li>		Chemical profiling of wells</li>	<li>		Sampling at points of inflow to well</li>	<li>		LNAPL and DNAPL sampling</li>
</ul><div>	<strong>Voc sampling</strong>
</div><p>	Discrete interval samplers (DIS) are excellent for VOC sampling. There is no mixing with water from different levels in the well. The sample does not travel through a long length of tubing, risking loss of volatile organics. The sample has minimal contact with air.</p><p>	For the most accurate VOC results, the Model 425T Transportable DIS can be used. It retains the volatiles at down-hole conditions with zero headspace during retrieval and transport to the laboratory.</p><div>	<strong>Advantages</strong>
</div><ul>	<li>		High quality samples</li>	<li>		Sample has not been pumped through tubing</li>	<li>		No mixing of water from different levels</li>	<li>		Minimal disturbance of the water</li>	<li>		Easy disassembly for decontamination</li>	<li>		Avoids purging and disposal of purge water</li>	<li>		Easy operation and transportation</li>

</div><p>	<strong>Samplers</strong> are constructed of stainless steel with Viton???? o-rings,FEP and polypropylene check balls.</p><p>	<strong>Tubing</strong> most commonly used is low density polyethylene (LDPE), however, FEP or FEP-lined polyethylene tubing is also available.

qed_well_wizard_dedicated_sampling_pump,QED Well Wizard Dedicated Sampling Pump,"<p>	Well Wizard pumps for MicroPurge sampling systems come in an unsurpassed range of sizes, materials, and capabilities, including models for deep wells, narrow or obstructed casings, and small-volume pumps for low-yield wells. Together with MicroPurge controllers, flow cells, and accessories, they create the most reliable, cost-effective low-flow system available.</p><p>	Field proven pump designs and exclusive, high performance PTFE bladder formulation offer the reliability critical to long-term monitoring. QED was first in the industry with a standard 10-year sampling pump warranty -- ''no-loopholes'' protection that covers the entire pump, including the bladder.</p><p>	Bladder pumps, EPA-accepted for low-flow sampling, have been shown to deliver superior sample accuracy and precision in dozens of independent studies. Over 50,000 Well Wizard bladder pumps are in use -- more than all other brands and types of dedicated ground water samplers combined.</p><p>	Well Wizard pumps are built for reliability, with refinements perfected over nearly 20 years of continuous engineering and improvement -- extra value you won't find in any other bladder pump. One example: stainless steel in Well Wizard pumps is electropolished to passivate the surface, delivering years more corrosion resistance than competitors' models.</p><p>	Pneumatic bladder pumps operate with a unique, gentle action ideal for low-flow sampling. Timed on/off cycles of compressed air alternately squeeze the flexible bladder to displace water out of the pump, and release it to allow the pump to refill by submergence, without creating any disturbance that could affect sample chemistry. Bladder pumps run easily at low rates for extended times, without the problems of other devices.</p><ul>	<li>		No overheating of high-speed electric pump motors, which can alter samples and ruin the pumps.</li>	<li>		No churning action, like that of bailers or inertial-lift samplers that increase turbidity.</li>	<li>		No suction to cause degassing of dissolved volatile contaminants.</li>
</ul><p>	The bladder prevents contact between the pump drive air and the sample, and the downwell equipment is permanently dedicated to each well, so both samples and the well are protected from disturbance or the danger of cross-well contamination.</p><p>	Well Wizard bladder pumps are part of the complete MicroPurge equipment system for low flow sampling, engineered for easy installation and use. QED application specialists will help specify the most effective, economical pumps and accessories for your site.</p><p>	Each pump is cleaned and laboratory-certified to be free of volatile organic compounds, acid extractable and base neutral contaminants. Your system is preassembled, with tubing cut to length, ready to install.</p><p>	If desired, installation by OSHA-certified field technicians is available. QED customer support -- with trained local representatives, 24-hour toll-free hotline, and next-day loaners or service turnaround when nee ded -- backs you with unmatched expertise and service.</p><p>	More MicroPurge dedicated sampling systems and pumps have been chosen since 1982 than all other manufacturers' equipment combined.</p><p>	To find out why, call QED today for a Low-Flow Data Sheet and site-specific cost analysis.</p>",QED,Equipment,"Bladder Pumps & Controllers, Esale, Ground Water Sampling, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,54742/61223,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/1755.jpg?v=1594742154,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active
gilian_gilair_air_sampling_pump,Gilian GilAir Air Sampling Pump,"<p>	A GILIAN Personal Air Sampling System is worn by a worker during the work shift to determine exposure to ambient particulates, gases, or vapors. It draws a carefully controlled volume of air and contaminants through collection media over the period. The media is then sent to a laboratory for analysis, resulting in a calculated level of exposure.</p><h3>	Automatic Constant Flow</h3><p>	This is the most important feature of any sampling pump, and is standard on all GILIANÃ‚ ® Pump models (except BDX-II). It assures pulsation-free flow is maintained within Ã‚ ±5% of the initial set point, even with varying back pressures from flow restrictions or buildup of material on the filter.</p><h3>	Battery LED</h3><p>	These lights tell you when the battery pack is fully charged, assuring a minimum of 8 hours of service over the operating range.</p><h3>	Clock/Programmable Timer</h3><p>	Clock pump models have a digital display with elapsed time, including a Run/Hold function to pause and resume sampling. This option is available for all GILIANÃ‚ ® pump models except BDX-II.</p><p>	Another option available on most models is a programmable timer which can be used to start or stop the pump at preset time intervals or to program a delayed start.</p><h3>	Built-In Rotameter</h3><p>	A rotameter with graduated LPM scale is standard on all models except LFS-113 and GilAir II, giving you an easy way to visually inspect to make sure the pump is maintaining the required flow rate throughout the sampling period.</p><h3>	Instant Fault Function</h3><p>	The fault light indicator is activated when the pump attempts to operate outside Ã‚ ±5% of the required flow rate, such as from low battery, blocked tubing or filter, or other severe flow restriction. If fault condition persists for 30-60 seconds, pump automatically shuts down and freezes the timer. Units with timer display preserve run time on the display, ensuring a valid sampling result. If fault condition is cleared before shutdown, the pump resumes normal sampling and fault light goes out. GILIAN Pumps offer this fault feature while in constant low flow mode.</p><h3>	Anti-Tamper Control Cover</h3><p>	A cover plate is set in place over the control panel with a single screw, protecting flow control settings and off-on switch from inadvertently being changed during sampling period.</p><h3>	Low Flow Module With Constant Flow Control</h3><p>	These modules can be quickly added to most high flow GILAIR pumps to adapt them to the lower flow rates required for sorbent tube sampling. Also available is a multiflow low flow module, which maintains constant pressure and allows sampling with multiple sorbent tubes, each with an independently set flow rate.</p><h3>	Both suction and discharge sampling</h3><p>	This feature makes pump suitable not only for conventional pull-through sampling media but also for bag sampling and other pressure applications.</p><h3>	See-Through Inlet Filter Housing</h3><p>	This feature protects pump from dirt and debris and is externally mounted on the pump, making it easy to visually inspect the filter. Filter replacement requires the removal of just four screws. Built-in moisture trap helps prevent moisture from entering and damaging the pump chamber, such as moisture carryover from impingers.</p><h3>	One Year Warranty</h3><p>	Twelve month warranty is standard, guaranteeing all pumps against any defects in parts and/or workmanship.</p><h3>	Rechargeable NiCad Battery Packs</h3><p>	These sealed battery packs provide approximately 8 to 10 hours of reliable operation on a single charge. They may be charged in place on the pump or easily detached for separate charging or for quick field change in a safe area. Packs are intrinsically safe, as they are UL listed. They include a current limit circuit for explosion protection.</p><h3>	Stainless steel belt clip</h3><p>	Clip is extra wide to provide maximum comfort to wearer and prevent the pump from tilting.</p><h3>	EMI/RFI Protection</h3><p>	This shielding helps to make sure ambient radio and electromagnetic interference from plant operations donÃ¢â‚¬™t affect the pumpÃ¢â‚¬™s flow control and timer circuit functions, degrading the accuracy of your sampling.</p>",Gilian,Equipment,"Air Sampling Pumps, Esale, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/1710.jpg?v=1564636977,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

isco_750_area_velocity_flow_module,Isco 750 Area Velocity Flow Module,"<p>The sensor on the 750 module uses patented Doppler technology to directly measure average velocity in the flow stream. An integral pressure transducer measures liquid depth to determine flow area. The 6712 sampler then calculates flow rate by multiplying the area of the flow stream by its average velocity.<br> <br> The 750 gives you greater accuracy in applications where weirs or flumes are not practical, or where submerged, full pipe, surcharged and reverse flow conditions may occur. With area velocity you don't have to estimate the slope and roughness of the channel. And Isco's exclusive 500 kHz Doppler penetrates farther into deep flow streams than 1 MHz systems, whose shorter wavelength can cause them to give ""nearsighted"", velocity measurement in typical wastewater applications. The Doppler system continuously profiles the flow stream, eliminating profiling and calibration required by electromagnetic systems.</p>",Isco,Equipment,"Composite Samplers, Esale, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'51785,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/1731.jpg?v=1564637099,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active
isco_1640_liquid_level_actuator,Isco 1640 Liquid Level Actuator,"<p>The 1640 Liquid Level Actuator provides a simple, reliable way to trigger an Isco sampler to begin a sampling routine when the liquid level reaches a predetermined height. The 1640 comprises a conductivity probe that mounts above the stream, a control box that mounts on the sampler, and connecting cable. It can be used in conjunction with other devices such as a rain gauge or flow meter to trigger sampling on multiple conditions.<br> <br> With the control switch set to LATCH, the 1640 will actuate the sampler when the liquid rises to the probe assembly, and the sampler remains actuated when the liquid level recedes.

<p>The MicroPurge ® basicsTM MP10 Controller revolutionizes low-flow sampling with advanced logic control of purge flow and well drawdown. Simple up-down arrow keys increase and decrease purge flow, driving a microprocessor to recreate expert techniques for low-flow adjustment. Then, optimized settings are identified for recall in the next round of sampling.</p>
<p><span>The MicroPurge Controller, MP-10 is used to regulate the gas pressure going into the bladder pump based on the pumping depth. It also controls the purge cycles of the pump. The gas pressure squeezes on the bladder, forcing the water out of the bladder and into the discharge tubing. When the gas pressure is released the bladder expands and allows water to fill the bladder for another purge.</span></p>
<p>The MP10 also offers an easy way to prevent excessive monitoring well drawdown during purging, by linking to the optional MP30 Drawdown/Water Level Meter.</p>
<p>The lightweight, compact MP10 sets the pace for a new generation of genuine MicroPurge basics equipment, first in control and power for low-flow sampling.</p>
<h3>Simple, stable, repeatable flow rate setting</h3>
<p>The MP10 puts you in control of the most advanced low-flow sampling system ever made. You will purge and sample quickly and easily, with precise, steady low-flow pumping rates from one sampling event to the next.</p>
<p>QED's new basics equipment is also designed to take advantage of the opportunities for downsized equipment, which is lighter and more portable, reduces equipment cost, and increases sampling crew productivity. Simplified, sealed electronics are put together in a design that delivers famous QED durability and value.</p>

global_water_wl-15x_water_level_logger,Global Water WL-15X Water Level Logger,"<p>	Global Water's WL15X Water Level Logger provides a datalogger with a submersible pressure transducer for remote monitoring and recording of well depth measurements and water pressure data. This highly reliable and accurate water level recorder records 24,400 readings and is programmable from one reading per second to one reading per day. Ranges of 0-3', 0-15', 0-30', 0-60', 0-120' and 0-250' are available. A 25' cable is standard, and optional cable lengths are available up to 500'.</p><p>	The Water Level Recorder's datalogger is housed in a weather-resistant cylindrical enclosure that can slip inside a 2-inch pipe. The data recorder is easily adapted with standard hardware for well head mounting or other installations. The datalogger enclosure also houses an easily replaceable 9 VDC battery, which powers the Water Level Logger and level sensor for one year. Purchase of the WL15X includes Windows-based datalogging software, which allows easy upload of recorded data to standard spreadsheet programs on a PC computer.</p><p>	The Water Level Logger's level sensor is fully encapsulated with marine-grade epoxy so that moisture can never leak in or work its way down the vent tube to cause drift or level sensor failure (as is the case with other pressure sensors). The submersible pressure transducer uses a unique, highly flexible silicon diaphragm to interface between water and the sensing element. This silicon diaphragm protects the level sensor's electronics from moisture and provides a submersible water level transducer with exceptional linearity and very low hysteresis. The design of Global Water's water level sensor eliminates the issues associated with metal foil diaphragms, which tend to crinkle and stretch out over time causing drift, linearity, and hysteresis problems. The water level sensor is also protected by a stainless steel micro-screen cap, which makes fouling with silt, mud, or sludge virtually impossible.</p>",Pine Environmental,Equipment,"Esale, Rental, Water Level Meters",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/1779.jpg?v=1594742263,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

''Which Gain Setting to Use, Fixed or Variable?''</b><br>	The Variable gain mode provides, in effect, a rising gain or sensitivity with time.   This method gives greater weight to return signals that occur later in the measurement cycle and is beneficial on deeper wells where the return signal is more attenuated.   This also makes the units less susceptible to unwanted returns from various surfaces in the well casing that might interfere with a proper measurement.</font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'>The Variable gain mode is somewhat more susceptible to interference from pump noise or other sources of high ambient noise.   Also, in some specific configurations it is possible for the unit to favor a secondary return over the primary one and give a reading that is twice the actual water level.</font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'>The Fixed mode is less susceptible to interference from ambient noise and the secondary return problem.   This mode can be used to advantage in such cases.   Some sensitivity is sacrificed so the unit might not read the deepest water levels in this mode.</font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><b>Temperature Control</b><br>	Obtaining an accurate measurement with the sonic water level meter requires that the temperature setting on the meter be equal to the average air temperature inside the well casing.   The temperature setting corrects for the variation of the velocity of sound with the air temperature in the well bore.   The sonic water level meter's temperature toggle switch adjusts the temperature setting for the variation of sound velocity in the well casing.   The value set shows on the display and is retained until changed.</font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'>The correct temperature setting can be determined by using the TEMPERATURE MAP TABLE provided with the water level meter for the state where the meter will be used (temperature settings are provided for all states in the United States).   Alternatively, the reverse side of the map table has a LOOK-UP TABLE giving the setting if the well water and average monthly surface temperatures are known.</font></p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><i>Please note: The outside or ambient air temperature does not affect the water level meter operation, provided the meter and its components remain within the operating temperature range.</i></font></p><p>	  </p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><b><font color='""""' face='""""'>Sonic Water Level Meter Specifications</font></b></font></p><p>	<font color='""""' face='""""' size='""""'><i>Measurement range:</i> Normal 10-500 ft (3-152 m), Deep 200-1200 ft (61-366 m)<br>	<i>Display resolution:</i> 0.1 ft<br>	<i>Measurement accuracy:</i> </font></p>",Global Water,Equipment,"Esale, Rental, Water Level Meters",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'51733,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/water-level-meter.jpg?v=1609878935,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

The sensor directs a focused beam into the monitored water. The light beam reflects off particles in the water, and the resultant light intensity is measured by a photodetector positioned at 90 degrees to the light beam. The detected light intensity is directly proportional to the turbidity of the water. The turbidity sensor utilizes a second light detector to correct for light intensity variations, color changes, and minor lens fouling.</p><h3>	Turbidity Meter</h3><p>	The Global Water Turbidity Meter combines the turbidity sensor (described above) with a handheld meter that has a six digit LED screen, 4-button control panel, and an internal 9V battery.

<p>The CTD-Diver is a submersible datalogger for long-term uninterrupted, real-time water level monitoring using a pressure sensor when submerged at a fixed level under the water surface. The pressure sensor measures the equivalent hydrostatic pressure of the water above the sensor diaphragm to calculate the total water depth. In addition, to a pressure sensor, the CTD-Diver is also equipped with a 4-electrode conductivity sensor for measuring the true or specific electrical conductivity of the water. The Diver autonomously measures conductivity, pressure, and temperature and records them in its internal memory. The Diver is ideal for ground and surface water level applications.</p>

wildco_stainless_steel_hand_corer,Wildco Stainless Steel Hand Corer,"<p>	Wherever you can wade, float or find a dock, you can use the Wildco ® hand corer! Here is a low-cost, foolproof sampler especially intended for shallow coring in fresh, salt or brackish waters. Use is simplicity itself: merely push it into bottom sediments using handles on the head assembly. After the corer penetrates the bottom, twist or pull it free to retrieve your sample. In deeper water, you can attach a 5 - 15 foot long extension handle to the head. In deeper water yet, you can drop it by attaching a line to a clevis located on the head assembly between the handles. The hand corer works by creating a partial vacuum which holds the sample in place and helps prevent washout. As the tube is pulled up, the polyurethane flutter valve on the head assembly tightly seals the upper end of the sampler. As long as the bottom end of the tube is 2-3"" (50-75 cm) under water, the corers will hold.</p>",Pine Environmental,Equipment,"Composite Samplers, Esale, Rental, Soil Analysis, Water Samplers",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'61296,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/1197.jpg?v=1594742018,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

dexsil_petroflag_tph_analyzer_system,Dexsil PetroFLAG TPH Analyzer System,"<p>Relying on laboratory methods to determine hydrocarbon contamination in soil is both time consuming and expensive.  Laboratory methods, such as EPA Method 8015, are very expensive and have turnaround times of one to two weeks.</p>
<p>Most samples analyzed by this method limit the results to Gasoline Range Organics (GRO) or Diesel Range Organics (DRO).  When limiting the analysis to these two ranges, heavier fractions of hydrocarbons such as fuel oil, motor oil, hydraulic oil, gear oil, transformer oil and greases are ""not seen"" in the analysis and the soil samples are reported as clean even though these heavier hydrocarbons still exist in the soil.</p>
<p>Method 418.1 was the only broad spectrum ""Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon"" field test for soil. Although this test is quite accurate for dry soils, the extraction efficiencies for wet soil can be as low 10%.  This inability to solvate wet soil samples can lead to false negative results.  Method 418.1 also uses a chlorinated solvent (Freon) as its extraction solvent. Freon is environmentally unsafe, and its disposal costs are quite high.</p>
<p>The analyst now has another choice; an environmentally safe, inexpensive, field portable test called PetroFLAG. The PetroFLAG system is a field portable method for the determination of total petroleum hydrocarbons in soil.  It is both safe and easy to use. PetroFLAG does not distinguish between aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, but quantifies all fuels, oils, and greases as total hydrocarbons.  Analysis of a 10 gram soil sample is performed using three simple steps: extraction, filtration, and analysis.</p>
<p>The PetroFLAG system is completely field portable.  Everything needed to perform ten soil tests can be conveniently carried to the job site in a briefcase size carrying case.  The PetroFLAG meter is a light-weight, rugged hand-held unit powered by a 9-volt alkaline battery.  The meter is menu driven for ease of use and utilizes an EEPROM memory system. </p>
<p>Fifteen response factors are built into the analyzer depending on the analyte of interest.  Response factors correlate to fuels ranging from weathered gasoline to heavy crude oil.  The results are shown in ppm on an LCD display screen.</p>",Pine Environmental,Equipment,"Esale, Rental, Soil Analysis, Soil Sampling",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'51615,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/PF-Carrying-Case.jpg?v=1600986562,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

alphalab_dc_milligauss_meter_3_axis,AlphaLab DC Milligauss Meter 3 Axis,"<p>An improvement on the flux gate magnetometer, the AlphaLab DC Milligauss Meter measures magnetic fields (technically ""flux density""), up to several times the strength of the Earth field.  It has a resolution of 0.01 milligauss (1 nanotesla) and a range of +/-2000 milligauss (200 microteslas).  The meter's three magnetoresistive sensors are a major improvement over an uncompensated fluxgate magnetometer both in cost and stability.  In fact, the sensors approach a proton precession magnetometer in temperature stability.</p>
<p><strong>Each of the three displays has an extra digit compared with most portable magnetometers.</strong></p>
<p>Each is 4  ½ digits and displays in two ranges: +/- 1999.9 and +/- 199.99 milligauss. Update is three per second.  Because the Earth's field is typically about 500 milligauss, nine ""offset"",controls (three for each of X,Y,Z) allow you to add or subtract up to 600 milligauss with precision of .01 milligauss.  Therefore, the Earth's field can be subtracted out when required.                                            If reading in the more sensitive 199.99 range, this field neutralization feature is often necessary, because the field is usually stronger than 200 milligauss.</p>
<p>The wide dynamic range of the displays (19,999 count; both polarities), along with the large range of offset (+/- 600 milligauss) and high stability of the meter (+/- .01 milligauss), allow for stable detection of small changes in a large background field. On the higher sensitivity range, changes of .01 milligauss can be reproducibly measured in up to +/- 800 milligauss of background field. On the lower sensitivity range, absolute field of .1 milligauss can be measured in up to +/- 1999.9 milligauss of background field.</p>
<p>The sensor is a 25 mm (one inch) cube at the end of cable that is normally four feet long, but other custom lengths are available. Each axis reads negative when pointing toward the south pole of a magnet and positive toward north.</p>
<p>At fixed temperature, reproducibility is +/- 0.01 milligauss (1 nT) and the temperature coefficient of the offset is less than 0.01 milligauss/ °C. The temperature coefficient for gain is less than .0015%/ °C. As shipped, gain accuracy is +/-0.5% and the meter offset is +/- 0.5 milligauss with all offset knobs set at zero.  All specifications are at temperatures 0 to 45 °C. X,Y,Z are aligned with the cube edges to accuracy one degree unless you specify 1/10 degree in the drop-down box below.</p>
<p><strong>MGM3AXIS Output Jack Description:</strong></p>
<p>The outputs are an analog voltage, with 1 Volt = 1 Gauss +/- 0.5%. Range is +/- 2 gauss (= +/- 2V). Normally, it is a ""slow-moving"" DC voltage (valid DC to 3 Hz), but a higher bandwidth can be specified (DC to 300 Hz at the 3 dB point) at no extra cost.  The X, Y and Z outputs each has a separate BNC output with a single common ground.</p>",AlphaLab,Equipment,"Esale, Radiation & EMF Meters, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54486,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/1253.jpg?v=1564634318,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

qed_pneumatic_displacement_pump_pulse_pump,QED Pneumatic Displacement Pump - Pulse Pump,"<p>Cleanup well conditions can be downright hostile: powerful solvents, gasoline and fuel oil, strong acids, caustic bases, corrosive chlorides. That's why QED makes the Pulse Pump series (our basic gas displacement pumps) in a variety of proven materials that won't just survive, but will deliver years of trouble-free performance.</p>
<p>Every Pulse Pump model has only two moving parts downwell: high-clearance, self-cleaning ball check valves. This simplicity keeps them working when high solids, viscosity, or chemical attack cause other pumps to clog or breakdown. An external controller is required to control the alternating pressurization and venting cycles for the pump.</p>
<p>The Pulse Pump design is especially suited for sinking hydrocarbons (DNAPL) recovery, which is often complicated by high viscosity and/or extremely aggressive solvents.</p>
<p>Intrinsically safe Pulse Pump systems are fast and easy to install, with no electrical connections at the wellhead.</p>
<p>Flow optimization is simple too; rugged, dependable pumps and controllers (the solar/AC powered C100M and the all-pneumatic L360) deliver reliable operation without needing frequent attention or repair.</p>

First, you can instantly select from up to nine of the most widely used pressure units without having to waste time and risk mistakes with tedious conversions. Next, a non-volatile memory function enables storage of up to 40 readings - perfect for HVAC technicians making Pitot tube traverses of airflow readings across a duct. The Series 477 is FM approved intrinsically safe for hazardous locations, Class 1, Div. 1, Group A, B, C, D, T4.</p><p>	When working in poorly lighted areas, just switch on the handy backlight feature. It automatically shuts itself off after 20 minutes to minimize battery drain. Electronic zeroing means you simply touch a single key to perfectly null out any minor pressure differences. A display HOLD key freezes the current pressure for those all-too-common situations where readings fluctuate. We even included an audible alarm to warn you of overpressure plus a visual alarm also confirms a value has been stored, eliminating the need to observe display during a duct traverse.</p><p>	A new option for the Series 477 is a USB interface. Combined with the 477's datalogging capability, a user can now quickly and conveniently download the stored readings to any USB compatible device.

alpha_lab_vector_magnitude_gaussmeter,Alpha Lab Vector/Magnitude Gaussmeter,"<p>The Vector Gaussmeter displays the true magnitude of the field at any location as well as the X Y Z components of up to 800 gauss. Also separately displays peak values of X Y Z and magnitude.  There is a sound alarm that determines the locations where the field magnitude exceeds user-set threshold.</p>
<p>Because magnitude is measured the orientation of the sensor (E-W N-S and up-down) is not important; this is unlike a 1-axis gaussmeter.  With the VGM the user can set the alarm to 15 gauss (for example) and it will sound (simultaneous with a red light) whenever the field exceeds 15 gauss for at least 5 milliseconds.  Using the meter this way it is easy to make a map of the 15 gauss line (or for whatever threshold is set) around a strong magnet. When using the alarm of a steel part can be rapidly scanned to show if any areas exceed the set threshold.  Then the ""peak hold"",function can be interrogated showing the peak values of X Y Z (including polarity) and magnitude that occurred during the scan.  Peak hold also has a 5 millisecond response time.</p>
<p>The ""reset"",button resets all peak hold registers to the present values of X Y Z and magnitude which are displayed in real time when the knob is set to ""measure.""  Offsets can be manually applied to X, Y and Z or a ""relative zero"",can be applied to all three.

aut_solutions_accutrak_automated_3_axis_scanner,AUT Solutions AccuTrak Automated 3-Axis Scanner,"<p>The AccuTrak is the first ever ""truly modular"", scanner which offers both 3 or 2 axis versions and has the ability to scan just about any contoured ferrous surface. AUT Solutions was the first in the industry to design and manufacture modular style scanners to make repairs and modifications in the field easy and low cost to the customer. The AccuTrak is our latest scanner from this design concept that adds more flexibility than standard fixed wheels scanners as this scanner is steerable using a small hand held joystick or even your computer mouse.</p>
<p>The AccuTrak truck assemblies rotate in multi-axis' to allow near perfect wheel contact to a flat or curved surface using its two powerful X-axis drive motors and magnetic wheels to help propel the scanner and umbilical vertically with little load, even when crossing over weld seam. The truck assembly can be locked into place for conventional 2-axis style scanning or can be unlocked to allow the scanner to become steerable on curved surfaces which is well suited for remote access corrosion mapping or weld inspection utilizing pulse echo, phased array or TOFD technologies.   The AccuTrak comes standard as a 3 axis scanner, but the 3-axis arm can be removed to perform simple line or weld scans. The AccuTrak scanning system can be provided with many options, such as multi-probe weld inspection, a battery powered green laser line for weld tracking which can be visible in almost any light condition, and also a camera for weld tracking purposes. The AccuTrak is also capable of performing automated weld tracking utilizing a patent pending technology by AUT<br> Solutions to automatically track the scanner to the center line of a weld thus the use of heavy and awkward tracks are a thing of the past.</p>",AUT Solutions,Equipment,"Esale, Rental, Ultrasonic Flaw Detectors & Phased Array Systems",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54841,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/1314.jpg?v=1564634630,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

fieldscout_direct_soil_ec_meter,FieldScout Direct Soil EC Meter,"<p>This instrument has been specifically designed for direct measurement of salts in soil media as well as water or nutrient solutions. The salinity of the soil solution, irrigation water or fertilizer solution is an important parameter affecting the root zone environment. Any of these factors can have a significant effect on plant growth and physiology. The easiest way to monitor salinity is by measuring the electrical conductivity (EC). EC is strongly correlated to the salinity of the soil solution. EC measurement is also affected by temperature and, to a lesser degree, by soil moisture content.   Use this portable EC meter and probe to measure salinity in greenhouse soil media right on the spot without tedious soil sampling and preparation. Greenhouse production managers can compare readings from plant to plant and fine-tune their fertility program because measurements can be made directly in a plug tray cell without cannibalizing the seedlings. Turf managers can monitor for high salt levels on golf course greens and determine when to flush (leach) salts before turf quality declines. The meter comes with the Field Scout Soil/Water EC probe. This single, stainless steel probe has a specially designed conical tip. It can measure liquid EC (water or nutrient solutions) or In-Situ soil salinity. The probe automatically compensates for temperature.</p>

teledyne_model_701_zero_air_system,Teledyne Model 701 Zero Air System,"<p>The Model 701 is an excellent source of clean, dry air for dilution calibrators. It also may be used as a source of purge air for permeation tube ovens or burner air for FID analyzers. The regenerative, heatless dryer removes water and produces gas with a dewpoint of less than -20°C (up to 15 SLPM flow rate) independent of the inlet dewpoint and assists in the removal of other gases, greatly increasing the life of the chemical scrubbers. The basic Model 701 includes an oil and diaphragm free pump plus scrubbers to remove SO2, NO, NO2, O3, NH3, and H2S. Optional high-performance scrubbers are available to remove CO and Hydrocarbons.   Inlet air is pulled into the pump and routed through a pre-cooler and water trap to remove moisture. The air then passes through the regenerative scrubber for final drying and then to the storage tank. The tank pressure is monitored and maintained at a preset level by cycling the pump automatically as needed, thereby extending both the pump and scrubber life. Outlet air then passes through a filter to assure a clean,<br> dry, analytical zero air supply. A microcontroller cycles the regenerative dryer and water trap valves preventing the pump from starting against full head pressure. The Model 701 is an ideal accessory to the Model T700 Series Dilution Calibrators or as a zero air source for analyzers.</p>",Teledyne API,Equipment,"CEMS &amp; Protocol Gas, Dilution & Calibrators, Esale, Rental, Source Analyzers",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54945,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/1348.jpg?v=1564634822,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

qed_ap4plus_overview,QED AP4Plus,"<p><strong>Easier to Disassemble and Clean</strong></p>
<p>The AP4+ was made easier to clean by using 3 bolts to attach the pump inlet and open up the pump. This is easier than having to rotate the inlet multiple turns to unthread it from the center tube inside the pump, especially under field conditions of silt, deposits and coatings. Removing the inlet is also aided by the new, precision ID pump casing, ensuring a more controlled fit. The new pump casing's smoother internal surface has the added benefit of reducing the rate of buildup of solids and coatings inside in some cases. The Easy Fittings make it a snap to remove the tubing from the pump without cutting, and the float is now easily removed by pulling a clip.</p>
<p><strong>Upgraded Materials</strong></p>
<p>The new AP4+ features upgraded materials for many parts to further extend the service life of the pump and to broaden the range of conditions each model can be used in. All nonmetallic internal parts are now made of PVDF*; this is   a high-grade engineering plastic with higher strength at elevated temperatures and extremely broad chemical resistance, including to acidic and oxidizing cleaning agents sometimes used for pump maintenance. All stainless steel parts have been upgraded to 316-grade for improved corrosion resistance.</p>",QED,Equipment,"Esale, Remediation Pumps, Rental, Submersible Pumps & Controllers",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'51828,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/qed-ap4plus.jpg?v=1609879571,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

schonstedt_magnetic_locator_model_ga-72_cd,Schonstedt Magnetic Locator Model GA-72 Cd,"<h3>Easy-To-Use</h3>
<p>The GA-52Cx and GA-72Cd Locators detect the magnetic field of iron and steel objects and energized power lines. Both provide audio detection signals that peak in frequency when the locator's tip is held directly over the target. The GA-72Cd has the option of nulling or peaking</p>
<h3><em>No. 1 Around the World in Performance and Reliability.</em></h3>
<h4>Quality Is Our Hallmark</h4>
<p>Schonstedt's underground magnetic locators have been setting the standards for reliability and dependability for over 30 years. They are designed to withstand the rigors of daily on-site usage and a wide range of environmental conditions. In fact, the Model GA-52Cx is so rugged and dependable it's backed by a 7-year warranty and the Model GA-72Cd is backed by a 5-year warranty.</p>
<h4>Only two Controls</h4>
<p>Designed for one-hand operations, the On/Off-Sensitivity and Volume controls are located on the underside of the cover on both locators. This provides easy access, protects the knobs and contributes to their overall ruggedness and dependability.</p>
<p>The GA-72Cd also has easy-to-read digital and bar graph which displays of signal strength and polarity. Once you have located a target using the audio signal, the digital readout and polarity indicators will help you to visually pinpoint the target and, in some instances, even determine its orientation.</p>
<h4>Signal Strength and Polarity Indications</h4>
<p>The GA-72Cd's audio signal and the 3-digit LCD readout will peak, and the (+) or (-) bar graph will expand to full scale when its tip is directly over a vertical iron pipe. One end of a horizontal target will be (+) and the other will be (-). This difference is very significant because it helps you to distinguish between vertical and horizontal pipes.</p>
<p>With the GA-72Cd you can select any one of four sensitivity settings; the GA-52Cx offers five sensitivity settings. The GA-72Cd's LCD bar graph shows the selected gain and the battery status. The GA-72Cd's headset jack can be connected to your data logger using a standard stereo audio plug.</p>
<h4>Choice of Two Audio Modes</h4>
<p>The GA-72Cd is configured initially to provide an audio signal that is always present (Audio Output switch set to ''B''). If you do not want to hear a signal until the locator is within the detection range of a target, you can set the Audio Output Switch to ''A''.</p>

pearpoint_flexiprobe_p340_push_rod_system,Pearpoint Flexiprobe P340 Push Rod System,"<p>	At the heart of the P340 flexiprobe system is the ruggedized and weatherproofed P340USB flexiprobe controller, which records high quality digital video or images with a single button press, and displays them on an ultra-bright 8"", TFT screen. Advanced digital capabilities mean that users can zoom, pan and rotate images during recording to focus in on problem areas. The P340 flexiprobe can be adapted to any inspection requirement. A choice of 1"", (25mm) or 2"", (50mm), ultra-durable cameras can be mounted on range of 5 different reels from the extra-flexible 100' (30m) P341 Plumbers reel to the 500' (150m) P343 reel designed to push for longer distances. The 2"" (50mm) camera is self leveling, keeping the video picture upright when navigating a pipe.</p><p>	Compact reel designs ensure that the systems are fully transportable, and protected in transit. A range of compatible sondes, skids, brushes and accessories completes the package, allowing inspection of pipes up to 9"", (230mm) in diameter.</p><p>	<strong>Flexible USB and Compact Flash data storage</strong><br>	The P340USB controller fully supports the popular USB flash drive. An operator's (or their customer's) memory stick can be simply plugged in to the controller to record, store or copy inspection videos, photos and observations. The system is also compatible with Compact Flash memory cards, and can be connected directly to a PC to transfer data without the need for a card reader.</p><p>	<strong>Plumbers system</strong><br>	Pearpoint has developed a flexible Plumbers system designed to travel through   waste water systems, negotiating most traps (from 2""/50mm) and bends (from 1 1/4""/32mm) found in commercial and residential properties. With a flexible built-in sonde facilitating pinpointing of the camera position, this new 100' (30m) reel is the ideal tool for smaller diameter plumbing inspections.</p><p>	<strong>Outstanding picture quality from durable cameras</strong><br>	The P340 flexiprobe system offers a choice of new ultra-tough, high resolution, cameras constructed from 303 stainless steel, and capable of withstanding 11 bar of pressure - the equivalent of working 330' (100m) underwater.</p><p>	1"", (25mm) and 2"", (50mm) models are available, combining focusable lenses with dramatically improved video resolution and the latest generation ultra-bright white LEDs to deliver a perfect and clear picture in most pipe conditions.</p><p>	<strong>More productive on-site</strong><br>	The P340USB controller automatically organizes jobs by client, site and survey - making reporting and reviewing videos, photos and observations straightforward. The pre-installed comprehensive, and customizable, P340USB reporting sOne-touch recording to USB memory sticks and Compact Flash cardsstem can be used to quickly fill out report observations on-site. It can also produce SEWER.DAT report files, with no need to plug into a computer.</p><p>	<strong>Manage data and produce reports</strong><br>	The new Flexisight™ Manager software is the ideal PC companion for the P340USB controller, allowing the operator to import, store and manage their digital inspection data.</p><p>	Comprehensive reports can also be created with the operator's company branding, pipe graphics, descriptions and color coded defect grading (see literature for system requirements).</p>",Pearpoint,Equipment,"Esale, Pushrod Cameras, Rental",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,'54235,0.0,,deny,manual,0.00,,false,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4616/1748/products/p340_large_2b007a77-c5b3-4f08-be97-968c479439ea.jpg?v=1610046658,1,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,lb,,,active

quest_temp_34,Quest Temp 34 Area Heat Stress Monitor,"<p>The QUESTemp 34 area heat stress monitor struts its stuff with its ability to protect groups of workers with a single instrument. The dry bulb sensor measures ambient temperature. The wet bulb sensor takes into account evaporative cooling, giving an indication of the effects of humidity on an individual. And the globe sensor provides an indication of radiant heat exposure due either to direct light or hot objects in an environment. The QUESTemp 34 environmental monitor converts all these measurements to a simple, single-number indoor and outdoor WBGT index that can be used in conjunction with guidelines from ACGIH, the U.S. Navy, EPRI, ISO, and other standards-setting organizations. Use the QUESTemp 34 area heat stress monitor with any of these guidelines to determine appropriate work and rest regiments or stay times for workers in situations where heat stress is a life safety issue and a liability risk.

oil_in_soil_screening_kit,Oil in Soil Screening Kit,"<p>The OIL-IN-SOIL™ field screening test kit is an inexpensive, simple and rapid qualitative sampling test for identifying the presence of hydrocarbons including LNAPLs and DNAPLs in soil.  The OIL-IN-SOIL™ test kit is a visually enhanced version of the old Soil-Water Shake Test for the presence of oils and petroleum products.  Users add soil to a line on the label, add water to another line on the label and shake the jar to release the dyes. </p>
<p>The Kit comes in 3 colors: One kit uses the original SUDAN IV which colors the hydrocarbon red.  The OIL-IN-SOIL™ Kits also come in a Royal Blue color called OIL-IN-SOIL™RB . A colored ring or spots indicates the presence of oil or petroleum at above 2,500 ppm.TPH). A Styrofoam ball turning pink or light blue, depending on the dye used will indicate hydrocarbon down to 500 ppm. Many DNAPLs will give indications below 10 ppm because of their ability to penetrate the styrene use din the jar.</p>
<p><u><strong>Application:</strong></u><br> The OIL-IN-SOIL™ field screening test kits are useful tools for reducing the cost of Phase I and Phase II site assessments, by reducing the time and costs associated with delineating the perimeter, depth and direction of spills in soil. They are also often used with core samples to identify organic substances.</p>
<p><u><strong>Environmental Benefits:</strong></u><br> Rapid delineation of hydrocarbons and DNAPL spill boundaries in soil, results in more rapid removal of contaminants from the environment. The OIL-IN-SOIL™ kit uses a deminimus quantity of Sudan IV which is encapsulated in a soluble cube – thus decreasing the hazards to the test user from airborne particulate Sudan IV and overcoming the problems associated with disposal of larger quantities of a mutagenic dye. We have recently switched to a new manufacturer whose dye is non mutagenic.</p>
<p><strong><u>Performance:</u></strong><br> The OIL-IN-SOIL™ kits provide an inexpensive, consistent tool for the detection of hydrocarbons (+- 500 ppm TPH) in soil. They are easy to use and require minimal training – thus reducing the need for ongoing expensive technical support on site. The OIL-IN-SOIL™ kits have been sold commercially for several years and are used for Phase I and Phase II site assessments by most major environmental companies and several utility companies throughout the USA .</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Simple as 1, 2, 3:</strong></u></p>
<ol>
<li>Add soil to the first line on the label.</li>
<li>Add water to second line on the label.</li>
<li>Close and shake the jar to release the dyes and observe the color change.</li>
